Starring Marina Vlady, Anny Duperey, Joseph Gerhard

In 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER (2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D’ELLE), Jean-Luc Godard beckons us ever closer, whispering in our ears as narrator. About what? Money, sex, fashion, the city, love, language, war: in a word, everything. Among the legendary French filmmaker’s finest achievements, the film takes as its ostensible subject the daily life of Juliette Janson (Marina Vlady), a housewife from the Paris suburbs who prostitutes herself for extra money. Yet this is only a template for Godard to spin off into provocative philosophical tangents and gorgeous images. 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER is perhaps Godard’s most revelatory look at consumer culture, shot in ravishing widescreen color by Raoul Coutard."

Starring Jasmine Thiré, Michel Jeannès, Jacky Patin

A billowing pink dress launches a stouthearted teenage girl on a time- and space-collapsing odyssey from her humble goat farm to the big city and beyond in this playfully meandering feminist fantasia from Agnès Varda. Commissioned by Italian high-fashion house Miu Miu and shot in part on Varda’s beloved Parisian home street, rue Daguerre, LES 3 BOUTONS slyly juxtaposes the ancient and the modern, the pastoral and the urban, the real and the imaginary to create a fairy tale rooted not in passive wish fulfillment but in spirited self-empowerment."

Starring Behnaz Jafari, Jafar Panahi, Marziyeh Rezaei

Iranian master Jafar Panahi’s fourth feature since he was officially banned from filmmaking is a courageous act of antipatriarchal defiance from an artist who has refused to be silenced. This playful docufiction road movie begins with a smartphone video sent to the director and real-life star actress Behnaz Jafari from a desperate young woman who, distraught at her family’s refusal to let her study drama, seemingly records her own suicide. Traveling to the woman’s rural hometown to investigate, Panahi and Jafari find themselves launched on a slyly comic, quietly revelatory journey that builds in narrative, thematic, and visual intricacy to put forth a grand expression of community and solidarity under the eye of oppression."

In a dusty, underpopulated California resort town, a naive southern waif, Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek), idolizes and befriends her fellow nurse, the would-be sophisticate and “thoroughly modern” Millie Lammoreaux (Shelley Duvall). When Millie takes Pinky in as her roommate, Pinky’s hero worship evolves into something far stranger and more sinister than either could have anticipated. Featuring brilliant performances from Spacek and Duvall, this dreamlike masterpiece from Robert Altman careens from the humorous to the chilling to the surreal, resulting in one of the most unusual and compelling films of the 1970s."

Director Tancred Ibsen&#39;s penchant for depicting rustic life shines through in the bucolic scenes at the start of THE VI OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES, OSLO 1952. In addition to the exciting scenes of competition (Winter sports are followed with almost rabid fervor in Scandinavia), Ibsen records a sense of community spirit shared among the competitors."

Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, a director whose new project is collapsing around him, along with his life. One of the greatest films about film ever made, Federico Fellini’s 8½ (Otto e mezzo) turns one man’s artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema. An early working title for 8½ was THE BEAUTIFUL CONFUSION, and Fellini’s masterpiece is exactly that: a shimmering dream, a circus, and a magic act."

Hörmann deploys shots from a helicopter to present the landscape of Tyrol but also to show the skills of the athletes."

13 DAYS IN FRANCE, a personal project for French filmmaker Claude Lelouch, approaches the X Olympic Winter Games in a radical way, ignoring certain disciplines and dwelling on others. This impressionistic kaleidoscope of a movie manages to be both freewheeling and intimate. Under the direction of Lelouch and François Reichenbach, 13 DAYS IN FRANCE pulses with the insouciant spirit of the sixties and the carefree cinematography and editing pioneered by the French New Wave."

The official film of the Games of the XIV Olympiad London 1948 is the first in color and seeks to comprise both the winter and summer events from that year.

For what would prove to be his final film, Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami gave himself a challenge: to create a dialogue between his work as a filmmaker and his work as a photographer, bridging the two art forms to which he had dedicated his life. Setting out to reconstruct the moments immediately before and after a photograph is taken, Kiarostami selected twenty-four still images—most of them stark landscapes inhabited only by foraging birds and other wildlife—and digitally animated each one into its own subtly evolving four-and-a-half-minute vignette, creating a series of poignant studies in movement, perception, and time. A sustained meditation on the process of image making, 24 FRAMES is a graceful and elegiac farewell from one of the giants of world cinema."

Delphine Zentout plays Lili, a precocious fourteen-year-old girl on a seaside family vacation. Drawn to a bitter middle-aged man (Étienne Chicot), Lili longs to lose her virginity and initiates a contest of wills in which she discovers herself more mature than, but still rattled by the equivocations of, her chauvinistic counterpart. Fueled by an extraordinary performance by then-sixteen-year-old Zentout, and featuring a scene-stealing Jean-Pierre Léaud as Lili’s brief confidant, 36 FILLETTE showcases Breillat as an incisive chronicler of the subtle evolutions of teenage desire."

Director Andrew Haigh carries the tradition of British realist cinema to artful new heights in 45 YEARS, weaving the momentous into the mundane as the pair go about their daily lives, while the evocatively flat, wintry Norfolk landscape frames their struggle to maintain an increasingly untenable status quo. Loosely adapting a short story by David Constantine, Haigh shifts the focus from the slightly erratic Geoff to Kate, eliciting a remarkable, nuanced portrayal by Rampling of a woman’s gradual metamorphosis from unflappable wife to woman undone."

At once a compelling piece of anti-isolationist propaganda and a quick-witted wartime thriller, 49TH PARALLEL is a classic early work from the inimitable British filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. When a Nazi U-boat crew, headed by the ruthless Eric Portman, is stranded in Canada during the thick of World War II, the men evade capture by hiding out in a series of rural communities, before trying to cross the border into the still-neutral United States.

With 65 REVISITED, Pennebaker returned to his trove of archival footage to create an alternate record of that now-legendary tour, assembling outtakes and unused footage for an equally intimate, revealing document of the brilliantly enigmatic singer-songwriter as he bid farewell to his acoustic phase. Devoting more time to the music than the original film, this essential companion piece features Dylan’s enthralling performances of songs like “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding),” “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right,” and “If You Gotta Go, Go Now,” alongside appearances by fellow luminaries like Joan Baez, Nico, and Bob Neuwirth."

The simultaneously random and interconnected nature of modern existence comes into harrowing focus in the despairing final installment of Michael Haneke’s trilogy. Seventy-one intricate, puzzlelike scenes survey the routines of a handful of seemingly unrelated people—including an undocumented Romanian boy living on the streets of Vienna, a couple who are desperate to adopt a child, and a college student on the edge—whose stories collide in a devastating encounter at a bank. The omnipresent drone of television news broadcasts in 71 FRAGMENTS OF A CHRONOLOGY OF CHANCE underscores Haneke’s vision of a numb, dehumanizing world in which emotional estrangement can be punctured only by the shock of sudden violence."

Peter Fonda stars as a wannabe fishing guide who finds himself drawn into a dangerous rivalry with a crusty, irascible backwater boatman (the one and only Warren Oates). The offbeat cast—including Harry Dean Stanton, Burgess Meredith, a pre–Lois Lane Margot Kidder, and Sylvia Miles—delivering deliciously florid dialogue in the sun-blasted Florida setting makes for a one-of-a-kind, almost surreally entertaining seriocomedy that eschews narrative structure in favor of a loose-limbed, lo-fi quirkiness."

Starring Deniz Celiloğlu, Merve Dizdar, Musab Ekici

Nestled away in wintry East Anatolia, public-school art teacher Samet (Deniz Celiloğlu) yearns to leave the sleepy village for cosmopolitan Istanbul. Further disenchanted when he and Kenan (Musab Ekici), a colleague, come under public scrutiny, Samet fears circumstances will keep him in Anatolia and his dreams of a new life permanently out of reach. A silver lining is a budding relationship with Nuray (Merve Dizdar), a fellow teacher and firebrand who develops connections with both Samet and Kenan, forcing Samet to confront what he can&#39;t readily accept. Renowned for his nuanced, visually ravishing imagery, award-winning director Nuri Bilge Ceylan (ONCE UPON A TIME IN ANATOLIA, WINTER SLEEP) capstones the film with one of his greatest sequences, a dazzling metacinematic climax featuring an entrancing performance from Dizdar, who took home Best Actress at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

ABOUT TAP features performances by and recollections from three of America’s leading male tap dancers: Steve Condos, Jimmy Slyde, and Chuck Green. Condos thinks of himself as an instrumentalist who focuses on the ankles and feet; Jimmy Slyde talks of “visual dancers” who “all make pictures”; and Chuck Green advises using the balletic port de bras technique.

A furiously anarchic, expressionistically heightened dissection of class relations, LES ABYSSES unfolds in a country home where domestic servants Michèle and Marie-Louise (played by real-life sisters Francine and Colette Bergé) are cruelly exploited by the family they work for.

Starring Jean-Claude Aimini, Daniel Descamps, Stefania Sabatini

In his bold yet playful feature debut—an overlooked gem of the French New Wave—Jacques Rozier satirizes several major cultural currents of early-sixties France: political myopia, romantic escapism, and commercial corruption. Young Michel (Jean-Claude Aimini) works as a camera technician for a television studio, where he meets two would-be actresses, Liliane (Yveline Céry) and Juliette (Stefania Sabatini). The duo’s demeaning work in advertising allows them to connect Michel with an unscrupulous director (Vittorio Caprioli), who subsequently stiffs him on a job. Fed up with their exploitative industry, Michel, Liliane, and Juliette head to Corsica for a holiday—and to track down the director—all while a developing love triangle strains the girls’ friendship. With confidence and panache, Rozier expertly employs documentary-style shooting, improvisational acting (among a mostly nonprofessional cast), and kinetic montage sequences to capture the disparity between blithe youth and the societal pressures—especially Michel’s imminent military service in Algeria—that threaten its innocence."

A freewheeling travelogue, a kaleidoscopic survey of the contemporary art scene, and a loving ode to creativity in all its forms, this five-part miniseries by the inimitable Agnès Varda takes us on a journey of discovery as she travels the globe—from Stockholm to St. Petersburg, Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City to Los Angeles—meeting with friends, artists, and fellow filmmakers. Along the way there are chats with titan auteurs Chris Marker (offering a window into his virtual-reality world) and a 102-year-old Manoel de Oliveira (doing his best Chaplin impersonation); visits to the Hermitage Museum, the Venice Biennale, and the home of Frida Kahlo; glimpses into the studios of acclaimed visual artists like Christian Boltanski, Annette Messager, and Pierre Soulages; and Varda’s casually profound musings on everything from rivers to the Dutch masters to her own photography and installation works.

Kinski’s unhinged performance, the mystical score by Popol Vuh, and the lush, hallucinatory jungle images come together in one of the most haunting, deliriously inspired visions in all of 1970s cinema, a senses-shattering journey to the edge of madness."

One of the most important documents of the AIDS epidemic, THE AIDS (Artists Involved with Death and Survival) SHOW deals with its impact on the community most affected by the disease: gay men. This unique work, one of the first films to deal with the subject of AIDS, was based on San Francisco’s long-running Theatre Rhinoceros stage production of the same name. It speaks to everyone who has ever thought about AIDS or any terminal disease.

It is a story that happens every day, told here in an uncompromising, groundbreaking work of realism from American independent filmmaker Robert M. Young. Vivid and spare where other films about illegal immigration might sentimentalize, Young’s take is equal parts intimate character study and gripping road movie, a political work that never loses sight of the complex man at its center. ¡ALAMBRISTA!, winner of the Cannes Film Festival’s inaugural Caméra d&#39;Or in 1978, remains one of the best films ever made on this perennially relevant topic."

Eisenstein drew on history, Russian folk narratives, and the techniques of Walt Disney to create this broadly painted epic of Russian resilience. This story of Teutonic knights vanquished by Prince Alexander Nevsky’s tactical brilliance resonated deeply with a Soviet Union concerned with the rise of Nazi Germany. Widely imitated, most notably by Laurence Olivier’s Battle of Agincourt re-creation for HENRY V, the Battle on the Ice scene remains one of the most famous audio-visual experiments in film history, perfectly blending action with the rousing score of Sergei Prokofiev."

Having spent the larger part of the 1960s and ’70s examining the rise and fall of Egypt’s first republic, director Youssef Chahine turned inwards with this kaleidoscopic, semi-autobiographical evocation of his wartime childhood, the first in a quartet of films collectively dubbed “Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.” A bustling, novelistically detailed recreation of the cosmopolitan Alexandria during World War II, the film follows Chahine’s teenage alter ego Yehia (Mohsen Mohieddin) as he escapes from the engulfing uncertainty of Egyptian reality into a world of Hollywood fantasy—only to find himself gradually pulled toward student activism. Working with some of Egypt’s biggest stars of the time and deftly balancing a dizzying array of subplots—including a queer romance—Chahine creates a deeply personal tapestry of art, politics, culture, and community at a transformative moment in Egyptian history."

ALEXIA is an experimental video about word-blindness and metaphor. Word-blindness is a condition that usually afflicts people who have suffered a stroke, causing them to lose the visual recognition of individual letters but perceive the entire word, or vice versa. Metaphor is here discussed in its function to reveal and obscure perception. Divided into five short sections, ALEXIA opens with a quote from a well-known Buddhist passage (“Do not mistake the finger for the moon”) and goes on to present Giambattista Vico’s theory of the origin of language and Ludwig Wittgenstein’s theory of aspect-blindness."

A German journalist (Rüdiger Vogler) is driving across the United States to research an article; it’s a disappointing trip, in which he is unable to truly connect with what he sees. Things change, however, when he has no choice but to take a young girl named Alice (Yella Rottländer) with him on his return trip to Germany, after her mother (Lisa Kreuzer)—whom he has just met—leaves the child in his care.

A lonely widow (Brigitte Mira) meets a much younger Arab worker (El Hedi ben Salem) in a bar during a rainstorm. They fall in love, to their own surprise—and to the outright shock of their families, colleagues, and drinking buddies. In ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL, Fassbinder expertly wields the emotional power of classic Hollywood melodrama to expose the racial tensions underlying contemporary German culture."

In a room, a young woman (Alix Cléo Roubaud) describes to a young man (Boris Eustache, the director’s son) the stories, techniques, and meanings behind several of her meticulously composed black-and-white photographs. But at some point, her explanations don’t seem to match what we see. Is this because language can never accurately account for the visual?

Jabez Stone is a hardworking farmer trying to make an honest living, but a streak of bad luck tempts him to do the unthinkable: bargain with the devil himself. In exchange for seven years of good fortune, Stone promises “Mr. Scratch” his soul. But when the troubled farmer begins to realize the error of his choice, he enlists the aid of the one man who might save him: the legendary orator and politician Daniel Webster. Directed with stylish flair by William Dieterle, ALL THAT MONEY CAN BUY (a.k.a. THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER) brings the classic short story by Stephen Vincent Benét to life with inspired visuals, an unforgettable, Oscar-winning score by Bernard Herrmann, and a truly diabolical performance from Walter Huston as the devil."

Starring Kani Kusruti, Divya Prabha, Chhaya Kadam

Payal Kapadia’s acclaimed fiction-feature debut is a radiant ode to hope-giving connections forged amid big-city anonymity. Set against the hypnotic luminescence of Mumbai, ALL WE IMAGINE AS LIGHT follows three very different women working at the same hospital—Prabha (Kani Kusruti), Anu (Divya Prabha), and Parvathy (Chhaya Kadam)—each contending with personal and material struggles amid a modernizing India riven by gentrification and rising Hindu nationalism. When eviction drives Parvathy back to her childhood village, the trio embark on an enchanting getaway by the sea, where they shake loose their remaining secrets and—in one otherworldly sequence—a lingering ghost. Winner of the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, ALL WE IMAGINE AS LIGHT is a deep-rooted study of the fortifying power of friendship, propelled by moving performances and the director’s compassionate eye.

A rediscovered treasure of independent cinema, this incisive comedic drama follows Rainbow Gold (Victoria Gabrielle Platt), a teenager coming of age in Brooklyn, as she looks to two vastly different models of womanhood: her straitlaced mother, Alma (Kim Weston-Moran), who runs a hair salon in the parlor of their home and disapproves of her daughter’s newfound interest in boys; and her free-spirited, larger-than-life aunt Ruby (Mizan Kirby), who has just returned from Paris after a ten-year absence and whose presence shakes up the household. Bursting with the bold Day-Glo colors of nineties fashion, this dazzling feature from feminist filmmaker and animator Ayoka Chenzira grapples with questions of Black women’s sexuality, agency, and self-image from a multigenerational perspective."

Wim Wenders pays loving homage to rough-and-tumble Hollywood film noir with THE AMERICAN FRIEND, a loose adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel “Ripley’s Game.” Dennis Hopper oozes quirky menace as an amoral American art dealer who entangles a terminally ill German everyman, played by Bruno Ganz, in a seedy criminal underworld as revenge for a personal slight, but when the two become embroiled in an ever-deepening murder plot, they form an unlikely bond. Filmed on location in Hamburg and Paris, with some scenes shot in grimy, late-seventies New York City, Wenders’ international breakout is a stripped-down crime story that mixes West German and American film flavors, and it features cameos by filmmakers Jean Eustache, Samuel Fuller, and Nicholas Ray."

Starring Eleonora Rossi Drago, Gabriele Ferzetti, Franco Fabrizi

This major early achievement by Michelangelo Antonioni bears the first signs of the cinema-changing style for which he would soon be world-famous. LE AMICHE (THE GIRLFRIENDS) is a brilliantly observed, fragmentary depiction of modern bourgeois life, conveyed from the perspective of five Turinese women. As four of the friends try to make sense of the suicide attempt of the fifth, they find themselves examining their own troubled romantic lives. With suggestions of the theme of modern alienation and the fastidious visual abstraction that would define his later masterpieces such as L’AVVENTURA, L’ECLISSE, and RED DESERT, Antonioni’s film is a devastating take on doomed love and fraught friendship.

Reeling from the death of his beloved mother and the negligence of his father (Stanislav Govorukhin), a powerful judge, ten-year-old Vasya (Igor Sharapov) forms a friendship with Valyok (Roman Levchenko) and Marusya (Oksana Shlapak), vagabond children who have taken refuge with a homeless man (Sergei Popov) in a crumbling church. Exposed to the desperate circumstances of a people whom he never knew existed, and enlivened by his new companions’ generosity and compassion, Vasya steals his sister’s porcelain doll to comfort the dying Marusya, setting his real and surrogate families on a potentially tragic collision course.

In many ways a breakthrough work for director Jacques Rivette (and a thematic precursor to his legendary OUT 1, released two years later), this epic portrait of a relationship in breakdown found the French New Wave’s most uncompromising auteur pushing the conventions of cinema to their limit to explore his trademark obsessions with the boundaries between performance and reality, stage and cinema, structure and improvisation, and the modern and the mythic. Amid rehearsals for a televised production of Racine’s “Andromaque,” an actor (Bulle Ogier) and theater director (Jean-Pierre Kalfon) see their marriage implode, a situation that grows increasingly volatile when he replaces her with his mistress."

After attempting suicide, a young woman (Amira Casar) makes a startling proposition to the man (Rocco Siffredi) who rescued her: she will pay him to watch her naked body over the course of four nights as long as he provides “impartial” commentary about what he sees. Thus ensues ANATOMY OF HELL, one of the most controversial films of Catherine Breillat’s career—a singularly daring meditation on the pleasures and horrors of the flesh. Buoyed by the two leads’ fearless performances, HELL is as much a philosophical treatise on the hidden traumas of sexuality as it is an increasingly unsettling battle of the sexes, with Breillat using a hushed chamber-play setup to show the spectator no quarter throughout the transgressive proceedings. The result is like nothing else, even within the director’s audacious oeuvre: her deepest expression of anguish over the unspeakable ecstasies and degradations of the body erotic."

AND NOW MIGUEL is known today as the beloved novel by Joseph Krumgold that won the Newberry Medal for excellence in American children’s literature in 1954. But few know that the story actually originated as a motion picture for the U.S. State Department directed by Krumgold. Miguel Chavez is the twelve-year-old son of a family of shepherds who dreams of joining the older men in his family as they take their flock of sheep out to pasture in New Mexico’s Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Small but determined, Miguel sets out to prove to his family that he is ready to take his place as a shepherd.

Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky • 1966 • Soviet Union
Starring Anatoly Solonitsyn, Ivan Lapikov, Nikolai Grinko

Tracing the life of a renowned icon painter, the second feature by Andrei Tarkovsky vividly conjures the murky world of medieval Russia. This dreamlike and remarkably tactile film follows Andrei Rublev as he passes through a series of poetically linked scenes—snow falls inside an unfinished church, naked pagans stream through a thicket during a torchlit ritual, a boy oversees the clearing away of muddy earth for the forging of a gigantic bell—gradually emerging as a man struggling mightily to preserve his creative and religious integrity. Appearing here in the director’s preferred 183-minute cut as well as the version that was originally suppressed by Soviet authorities, the masterwork ANDREI RUBLEV is one of Tarkovsky’s most revered films, an arresting meditation on art, faith, and endurance."

The life, art, and inner world of Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky is explored through the filmmaker’s own words and images in this appropriately hushed and reverent tribute to a cinematic titan. Lovingly made by the director’s son, ANDREI TARKOVSKY: A CINEMA PRAYER draws from a wealth of archival materials—rare audio recordings, photographs, film excerpts, and behind-the-scenes footage from the making of masterpieces such as ANDREI RUBLEV and STALKER—to reveal the filmmaker’s profoundly personal thoughts on topics like existence, death, religion, and cinema."

George Bernard Shaw&#39;s breezy, delightful dramatization of this classic fable, about a Christian slave who pulls a thorn from a lion&#39;s paw and is spared from death in the Colosseum as a result of his kind act, was written as a meditation on modern Christian values. And Pascal&#39;s final Shaw production plays it broadly, casting comic character actor Alan Young as the titular naïf. He&#39;s ably supported by Jean Simmons, Victor Mature, Robert Newton, and Elsa Lanchester."

Unobtrusively capturing the beauty and power of the New Zealand landscape while maintaining the film’s focus on the figure at its center, Campion broke new ground for female filmmakers everywhere and earned a sweep of her country’s film awards, along with the Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival."

Filmed in Kentucky, Missouri, and England, ANIMALICIOUS features a bomb-diving duck, a squirrel that thinks it’s landed on Normandy Beach, a hawk that could easily work for a hair-growth pharmaceutical company, a parakeet, a turkey, a hungry snake, and one tiny dog.

Fish (Jones) is a gentle Jamaican immigrant wrestling (quite literally) with his inner demons, while Poinsettia (Redgrave) is a brash eccentric with delusions of her own. When they meet as neighbors in a Los Angeles boardinghouse, a tentative relationship offers them both an escape from their shared loneliness.

ARAB ISRAELI DIALOGUE is the passionate final documentary from trailblazing filmmaker Lionel Rogosin, in which Palestinian poet Rashed Hussein and Israeli writer Amos Kenan engage in a frank, sometimes bruising conversation on the conflict between their peoples.

A work of such overwhelming grandeur that Jean Renoir told director Margot Benacerraf after viewing the film, “Above all . . . don’t cut a single image,” this poetic documentary-narrative hybrid is a landmark of both neorealist and feminist South American cinema. For five hundred years, the Araya peninsula in northeastern Venezuela has been mined for its salt. Through images of breathtaking beauty, Benacerraf captures the everyday lives of three families and their back-breaking work in the salt marshes, exquisitely preserving an embattled but tenacious way of life."

In his ruthlessly clear-eyed final film, French master Robert Bresson pushed his unique blend of spiritual rumination and formal rigor to a new level of astringency. Transposing a Tolstoy novella to contemporary Paris, L’ARGENT follows a counterfeit bill as it originates as a prop in a schoolboy prank, then circulates like a virus among the corrupt and the virtuous alike before landing with a young truck driver and leading him to incarceration and violence. With brutal economy, Bresson constructs his unforgiving vision of original sin out of starkly perceived details, rooting his characters in a dehumanizing material world that withholds any hope of transcendence."

In Kaurismäki&#39;s drolly existential crime drama, a coal miner named Taisto (Turo Pajala) attempts to leave behind a provincial life of inertia and economic despair, only to get into ever deeper trouble. Yet a minor-key romance with a hilariously dispassionate meter maid (Susanna Haavisto) might provide a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. Ariel, which boasts a terrific soundtrack of Finnish tango and Baltic pop music and lovely cinematography by Kaurismäki&#39;s longtime cameraman Timo Salmimen, put its director on the international map."

The crowning triumph of a career cut tragically short, the final film from Larisa Shepitko won the Golden Bear at the 1977 Berlin Film Festival and went on to be hailed as one of the finest works of late Soviet cinema. In the darkest days of World War II, two partisans set out for supplies to sustain their beleaguered outfit, braving the blizzard-swept landscape of Nazi-occupied Belorussia. When they fall into the hands of German forces and come face-to-face with death, each must choose between martyrdom and betrayal, in a spiritual ordeal that lifts the film’s earthy drama to the plane of religious allegory.

A milestone of Polish cinema, this electrifying international sensation by Andrzej Wajda—the final film in his celebrated war trilogy—entwines the story of one man’s moral crisis with the fate of a nation. In a small Polish town on the final day of World War II, Maciek (the coolly charismatic Zbigniew Cybulski), a fighter in the underground anti-Communist resistance movement, has orders to assassinate an incoming commissar. But when he meets and falls for a young barmaid (Ewa Krzyżewska), he begins to question his commitment to a cause that requires him to risk his life. ASHES AND DIAMONDS’ lustrous monochrome cinematography—wreathed in shadows, smoke, and fog—and spectacularly choreographed set pieces lend a breathtaking visual dynamism to this urgent, incendiary vision of a country at a crossroads in its struggle for self-determination."

In this endlessly diverting compendium of four short films, Pierre Etaix regards the 1960s from his askew but astute perspective. Each part is as technically impressive as it is riotous: a man attempts to read a novel about vampires beside his sleeping wife but cannot seem to separate reality from fiction; a simple afternoon at the movies becomes a consumer-culture assault; a jarringly noisy urban landscape keeps a city’s population on edge; and a day in the country means something different to a picnicking city couple, a hunter, and a farmer."

Masahiro Shinoda&#39;s Assassin (aka Ansatsu) was the director&#39;s first period film - but it is hardly set in the &quot;safety&quot; of a past era, as its story, of a masterless samurai (Tetsuro Tamba) making his way amid the chaotic aftermath of Commodore Perry&#39;s forcible contact with Japan in 1853, seems to resonate clearly in Japan&#39;s post-World War II era. Shinoda presents a stark picture of social and political upheaval, spreading duplicity and dishonor, and the consequences of up-ending the established order in a society built on expectations of a rigid social order."

Set amid Hong Kong’s ruthless, neon-lit gangland underworld, this operatic saga of ambition, honor, and revenge stars Andy Lau Tak Wah as a small-time mob enforcer who finds himself torn between a burgeoning romance with his ailing cousin (Maggie Cheung Man Yuk, in the first of her iconic collaborations with the director) and his loyalty to his loose-cannon partner in crime (Jacky Cheung Hok Yau), whose reckless attempts to make a name for himself unleash a spiral of violence. Marrying the pulp pleasures of the gritty Hong Kong action drama with hints of the head-rush romanticism Wong would push to intoxicating heights throughout the 1990s, AS TEARS GO BY was a box office smash that heralded the arrival of one of contemporary cinema’s most electrifying talents."

Widely considered Kira Muratova’s masterpiece, THE ASTHENIC SYNDROME is also Soviet cinema’s grand avant-comic opus, a deconstructive portrait of the nation in the final, frenzied stages of the communist experiment. For its first forty minutes, shot in black and white, SYNDROME tells the story of a grieving widow (Olga Antonova) at wit’s end, lashing out at strangers on the street, impulsively quitting her nursing job, and sleeping with random men. Cut to a disastrous post-screening Q&amp;amp;A with Antonova: we’ve just watched a film-within-a-film as slept through by Nikolai (Sergei Popov, one of Muratova’s co-screenwriters), a narcoleptic schoolteacher whose subsequent wanderings lead to encounters (between sudden naps) with an expansive cross section of the failing Soviet Union’s beleaguered citizenry—digressive vignettes at once bizarre, disturbing, and hilarious. Deftly applying dizzying metafiction to her inimitable brand of humanistic farce, THE ASTHENIC SYNDROME is an ingenious fractal puzzle that captures the delirious death throes of an entire epoch."

Starring Ingrid Bergman, Liv Ullmann

AUTUMN SONATA was the only collaboration between cinema’s two great Bergmans: Ingmar and Ingrid, the monumental star of CASABLANCA. The grande dame, playing an icy concert pianist, is matched beat for beat in ferocity by the filmmaker’s recurring lead Liv Ullmann, as her eldest daughter. Over the course of a day and a long, painful night that the two spend together after an extended separation, they finally confront the bitter discord of their relationship. This cathartic pas de deux, evocatively shot in burnished harvest colors, ranks among the director’s major dramatic works."

Antonioni’s controversial international sensation is a gorgeously shot tale of modern ennui and spiritual isolation."

Volker Schlöndorff transported Bertolt Brecht&#39;s 1918 debut play to contemporary West Germany for this vicious experiment in adaptation, seldom seen for nearly half a century. Oozing with brutish charisma, Rainer Werner Fassbinder embodies the eponymous anarchist poet, who feels that bourgeois society has rejected him and sets off on a schnapps-soaked rampage. Hewing faithfully to Brecht&#39;s text, Schlöndorff juxtaposes the theatricality of the prose with bare-bones, handheld 16 mm camera work, which gives immediacy to this savage story of rebellion. Featuring a supporting cast drawn from Fassbinder&#39;s troupe of theater actors that also includes Margarethe von Trotta, BAAL demonstrates the uncompromising vision of its director, a trailblazer of the New German Cinema."

At once a rousing paean to artistic creation, a delicate evocation of divine grace, and the ultimate film about food, the Oscar-winning BABETTE’S FEAST is a deeply beloved treasure of cinema. Directed by Gabriel Axel and adapted from a story by Isak Dinesen, it is the lovingly layered tale of a French housekeeper with a mysterious past who brings quiet revolution in the form of one exquisite meal to a circle of starkly pious villagers in late nineteenth-century Denmark. BABETTE’S FEAST combines earthiness and reverence in an indescribably moving depiction of sensual pleasure that goes to your head like fine champagne."

Infused with a jazzy, nouvelle vague–inspired energy, Bo Widerberg’s feature debut has the freshness of youth. Building on his film criticism’s call for a socially relevant Swedish cinema, the writer turned director offers a vivid portrait of a young factory worker (Inger Taube) finding her way toward independence as she weathers unexpected pregnancy, learns hard lessons from relationships with two very different men, and leaves behind the only home she has ever known. Abetted by fellow filmmaker Jan Troell’s coolly beautiful monochrome cinematography, Widerberg takes a bold first step in his mission to create a cinema that is both engaged and engaging."

Two of contemporary cinema’s most electrifying eccentrics, Werner Herzog and Nicolas Cage, join forces for a thoroughly unhinged pulp fever dream. Not—despite the title—a remake of or sequel to the similarly named Abel Ferrara film, Herzog’s BAD LIEUTENANT unfolds in a neon-splashed, neonoir vision of post-Katrina New Orleans where amoral, drug-addled detective Terence McDonagh (Cage at his most gloriously unrestrained) finds himself teetering on the brink of insanity as he investigates the killing of five immigrants—a mystery that ultimately takes a backseat to Herzog’s wild, hallucinatory flourishes, including an extended, unforgettable “iguana cam” interlude."

Imagine you lived in a world where your only reliable news source became government propaganda overnight. That’s exactly what happened to the citizens of the Muscogee Nation in 2018. Out of 574 federally recognized tribes, the Muscogee Nation was one of only five to establish a free and independent press—until the nation’s legislative branch abruptly repealed the landmark Free Press Act in advance of an election. Refusing to accept this flagrant act of oppression, one defiant journalist, Angel Ellis, charges headfirst into a historic battle against her tribal government’s censorship and corruption."

The sacrificial elder at the center of the tale is Orin (Kinuyo Tanaka), a dignified and dutiful woman who spends her dwindling days securing the happiness of her loyal widowed son with a respectable new wife.

Starring Brahim Haggiag, Jean Martin, Saadi Yacef

One of the most influential political films in history, THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, by Gillo Pontecorvo, vividly re-creates a key year in the tumultuous Algerian struggle for independence from the occupying French in the 1950s. As violence escalates on both sides, children shoot soldiers at point-blank range, women plant bombs in cafés, and French soldiers resort to torture to break the will of the insurgents. Shot on the streets of Algiers in documentary style, the film is a case study in modern warfare, with its terrorist attacks and the brutal techniques used to combat them. Pontecorvo’s tour de force has astonishing relevance today."

Cited by Buster Keaton as one of his personal favorites among his own films, this knockabout adaptation of a Broadway play revolves around a case of mistaken identity between two Alfred Butlers—one an effete millionaire (Keaton), the other the heavyweight champion of the world (Francis McDonald). Coincidence brings them to the same backwoods Kentucky neighborhood, where Butler-the-fop finds love with a mountain girl, but not before antagonizing Butler-the-brute into a Madison Square Garden grudge match."

“If we opened people up, we’d find landscapes. If we opened me up, we’d find beaches.” Originally intended to be Agnès Varda’s farewell to filmmaking, this enchanting auto-portrait, made in her eightieth year, is a freewheeling journey through her life, career, and artistic philosophy. Revisiting the places that shaped her—from the North Sea beaches of Belgium where she spent her childhood to the Mediterranean village where she shot her first film to the boardwalks of Los Angeles where she lived with her husband, Jacques Demy—Varda reflects on a lifetime of creation and inspiration, successes and setbacks, heartbreak and joy. Replete with images of wonder and whimsy—the ocean reflected in a kaleidoscope of mirrors, the streets of Paris transformed into a sandy beach, the filmmaker herself ensconced in the belly of a whale—The Beaches of Agnès is a playful and poignant record of a life lived fully and passionately in the name of cinema."

Amid the azure waters and sunbaked desert landscapes of Djibouti, a French Foreign Legion sergeant (Denis Lavant) sows the seeds of his own ruin as his obsession with a striking young recruit (Grégoire Colin) plays out to the thunderous, operatic strains of Benjamin Britten. Denis and cinematographer Agnès Godard fold military and masculine codes of honor, colonialism’s legacy, destructive jealousy, and repressed desire into shimmering, hypnotic images that ultimately explode in one of the most startling and unforgettable endings in all of modern cinema."

Regrettably overshadowed by offscreen drama on its release, the boldest directorial effort to date from Jodie Foster is a searing portrait of midlife crisis with one of the most audacious premises in recent memory. Cripplingly depressed, the formerly successful business executive and family man Walter Black (Mel Gibson) sees his life hit rock bottom—until redemption comes along in a most unexpected form: a beaver hand puppet that soon becomes his sole vehicle of communication. As the line between Walter and his beaver alter ego grows increasingly indistinguishable, his wife (Foster) begins to fear he may be lost forever."

Expecting his first child and still struggling to find steady employment, Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) involves himself in a relationship with a beautiful Japanese woman that threatens to destroy his marriage.

Catherine Deneuve’s porcelain perfection hides a cracked interior in one of the actress’s most iconic roles: Séverine, a Paris housewife who begins secretly spending her after­noon hours working in a bordello. This surreal and erotic late-sixties daydream from provocateur for the ages Luis Buñuel is an examination of desire and fetishistic pleasure (its characters’ and its viewers’), as well as a gently absurdist take on contemporary social mores and class divisions.

Taking its inspiration from a Balzac story, LA BELLE NOISEUSE centers on the tension that arises between an aging painter (Michel Piccoli) and his young model (Emmanuelle Béart) as he obsessively attempts to capture a truth beyond physical reality.

But it is Benedetta’s shocking religious visions that threaten to shake the Church to its core.

Benny (a frighteningly affectless Arno Frisch), the teenage son of wealthy, disengaged parents, finds release in the world of violent videos—an obsession that leads him to create his own monstrous work of real-life horror. Layering screens within screens and frames within the filmic frame, BENNY’S VIDEO is a coolly postmodern, metacinematic labyrinth in which the boundaries between actual and mediated violence become terrifyingly indistinguishable."

Just four years before his death, legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman sat down with Swedish documentarian Marie Nyreröd at his home on Fårö Island to discuss his work, his fears, his regrets, and his ongoing artistic passion. This resulted in the most breathtakingly candid series of interviews that the famously reclusive director ever took part in, later edited into the feature-length film BERGMAN ISLAND. In-depth, revealing, and packed with choice anecdotes about Bergman’s oeuvre, as well as his personal life, Nyreröd’s film is an unforgettable final glimpse of a man who transformed cinema."

Starring Vicky Krieps, Tim Roth, Mia Wasikowska

Writer-director Mia Hansen-Løve embarks on a luminous summertime odyssey to the home of Ingmar Bergman for her seventh feature, a graceful, shape-shifting tale about the interplay of life and art and the ways in which stories are born. In search of inspiration for their current filmmaking projects, Chris (Vicky Krieps) and her partner (Tim Roth) travel to the remote island of Fårö, Sweden, where Bergman lived and worked for decades. There, the spirit of the cinema master looms as Chris confronts her complicated relationships to work, men, motherhood, and her artistic influences. Also featuring radiant performances from Mia Wasikowska and Anders Danielsen Lie, BERGMAN ISLAND is a rich deconstruction of the mysteries of the creative process and the journey that every film takes from thought to page to screen."

At a desolate Romanian monastery, a young novice nun, Voichita (Cosmina Stratan), reunites with her former companion Alina (Cristina Flutur), who plans to take her to Germany. But Voichita proves unwilling to abandon her calling, and Alina becomes increasingly desperate to reclaim her devotion, putting the outsider at odds with the monastery&#39;s ascetic priest, and precipitating a painfully misguided, brutal attempt to save her soul.

Hilma af Klint was an abstract artist before the term existed, a visionary, trailblazing figure who, inspired by spiritualism, modern science, and the riches of the natural world, began in 1906 to reel out a series of huge, colorful, sensual, strange works without precedent in painting. The subject of a recent smash retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum, af Klint was for years an all-but-forgotten figure in art-historical discourse, before her long-delayed rediscovery. Director Halina Dryschka’s dazzling, course-correcting documentary explores not only the life and craft of af Klint, but also the process of her mischaracterization and erasure by both a patriarchal narrative of artistic progress and capitalistic determination of artistic value."

Hailed around the world as one of the greatest movies ever made, the Academy Award-winning BICYCLE THIEVES, directed by Vittorio De Sica, defined an era in cinema. In poverty-stricken postwar Rome, a man is on his first day of a new job that offers hope of salvation for his desperate family when his bicycle, which he needs for work, is stolen. With his young son in tow, he sets off to track down the thief. Simple in construction and profoundly rich in human insight, BICYCLE THIEVES embodies the greatest strengths of the Italian neorealist movement: emotional clarity, social rectitude, and brutal honesty."

The result is at once a time capsule of hedonistic gay life in the 1970s, a tender depiction of gay romance that dispenses with the then-current narratives of self-hatred and self-pity, and a record of artistic creation that is itself a work of art."

Ousmane Sembène was one of the greatest and most groundbreaking filmmakers who ever lived, as well as the most renowned African director of the twentieth century—and yet his name still deserves to be better known in the rest of the world. He made his feature debut in 1966 with the brilliant and stirring BLACK GIRL. Sembène, who was also an acclaimed novelist in his native Senegal, transforms a deceptively simple plot—about a young Senegalese woman who moves to France to work for a wealthy white family and finds that life in their small apartment becomes a prison, both figuratively and literally—into a complexly layered critique of the lingering colonialist mind-set of a supposedly postcolonial world. Featuring a moving central performance by M’Bissine Thérèse Diop, BLACK GIRL is a harrowing human drama as well as a radical political statement—and one of the essential films of the 1960s.

Future Hammer-horror legend Terence Fisher helms this twisty British whodunit (also known as MURDER BY PROXY), in which Casey Morrow (Dane Clark)—an American in London with no visible means of support—stumbles into what seems like the deal of a lifetime during a drunken night out when gorgeous heiress Phyllis Brunner (Belinda Lee) offers him a fortune just to marry her. But when he wakes up the next morning in another woman’s apartment with blood on his coat and Phyllis’s father murdered, he finds himself ensnared in an elaborate mystery, which he must untangle through the fog of history’s worst hangover."

One of the first films to herald the arrival of the Czechoslovak New Wave, Miloš Forman’s stylistically inventive debut narrative feature follows the bumbling teenager of the title (Ladislav Jakim) over the course of a directionless summer as he starts (and fails at) a new job, flirts awkwardly, and grows increasingly exasperated with his parents. A refreshingly frank, unromanticized coming-of-age portrait, BLACK PETER captures the bewildering experience of adolescence with both empathy and sly humor."

Perhaps Masaki Kobayashi&#39;s most sordid film, BLACK RIVER examines the rampant corruption on and around U.S. military bases in Japan following World War II.

The extraordinary cast—including Reverend Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick, attorney and feminist activist Florynce “Flo” Kennedy, musicians Jim Collier, Wende Smith, Larry Johnson, and Reverend Gary Davis—tell stories of heartbreak and despair while their songs blow the roof off the rafters.

Uncomfortable silences, botched flirtations, and fleeting hints of warmth and humor punctuate Sylvia’s aching descent into solitude, compassionately portrayed by Leigh as symptomatic of humanity’s struggle to communicate and connect."

Scripted and shot by Charles Burnett, Billy Woodberry’s slice-of-life revelation is a key masterpiece of the LA Rebellion, the black independent-cinema renaissance that emerged from UCLA’s film school in the 1970s and ’80s. BLESS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS distills the social concerns and neorealist aesthetics of the movement into a sensitive exploration of the inner workings of community and family that pays homage to the power of the blues. Searching for steady work, Charlie Banks (Nate Hardman) views his chronic unemployment as a kind of spiritual trial. But day work and selling a few catfish can’t sustain a family of five. While his wife Andais (a remarkable Kaycee Moore) works to support them with dignity, Charlie finds comfort for his wounded sense of manhood in an affair that threatens his marriage and family."

Things go decidedly not as planned when she summons the spirit of his dead first wife (Kay Hammond), a severe inconvenience for his current one (Constance Cummings). Employing Oscar-winning special effects to spruce up Coward’s theatrical farce, BLITHE SPIRIT is a sprightly supernatural comedy with winning performances."

Strong performances and ingenious special effects help THE BLOB transcend the schlock sci-fi and youth delinquency genres from which it originates. Made outside of Hollywood by a maverick film distributor and a crew whose credits mostly comprised religious and educational shorts, THE BLOB helped launch the careers of McQueen and composer Burt Bacharach, whose bouncy title song is just one of this film’s many unexpected pleasures."

Williams appropriated footage from Roman Freulich’s 1936 inspirational short BROKEN EARTH to add stylish production value to this low-budget drama—but he proves to be quite the stylist himself with the images of the leering Satan and the stunning finale, in which the protagonist falls to the foot of a cross and is bathed in the literal blood of Jesus."

Joel and Ethan Coen’s career-long darkly comic road trip through misfit America began with this razor-sharp, hard-boiled neonoir set somewhere in Texas, where a sleazy bar owner releases a torrent of violence with one murderous thought. Actor M. Emmet Walsh looms over the proceedings as a slippery private eye with a yellow suit, a cowboy hat, and no moral compass, and Frances McDormand’s cunning debut performance set her on the road to stardom. The tight scripting and inventive style that have marked the Coens’ work for decades are all here in their first film, in which cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld abandons black-and-white chiaroscuro for neon signs and jukebox colors that combine with Carter Burwell’s haunting score to lurid and thrilling effect. Blending elements from pulp fiction and low-budget horror flicks, BLOOD SIMPLE reinvented the film noir for a new generation, marking the arrival of a filmmaking ensemble that would transform the American independent cinema scene."

Caught in the tangle of technology and social media, he wonders to his cat about his place in the world. If he spreads his wings, can he fly—perhaps to Hawaii, where the Marcoses once fled?

Starring Nora Aunor, Phillip Salvador, Raquel Montesa

Director Lino Brocka brings his trademark blend of melodrama and social realism to this lost-and-found masterwork of Filipino cinema, a troubling character study at the intersection of fandom, sexuality, and martyrdom. Superstar Nora Aunor—who produced the film, subverting her own fame—plays Bona, a middle-class girl from the Philippines who is obsessed with Gardo (Philip Salvador), a bit actor in low-budget films. When she decides to drop out of school to follow the object of her infatuation, her furious father casts her out and Bona moves in with her idol in the Manila slums. At first delighted to play house, the young woman soon finds herself not the wife, but the maid—at the mercy of Gardo’s every whim and desire, yet intent on enduring his unending parade of conquests in the hopes of finally being seen."

A low-key, semi-improvised postpunk diary that took four years to complete, BORDER RADIO features legendary rocker Chris D., of the Flesh Eaters, as a singer/songwriter who has stolen loot from a club and gone missing, leaving his wife (Luanna Anders), a no-nonsense rock journalist, to track him down with the help of his friends (John Doe of the band X; Chris Shearer).

A blistering rallying cry issued loud, clear, and unapologetically queer, Lizzie Borden’s explosive postpunk provocation is a DIY fantasia of female rebellion set in America ten years after a revolution that supposedly transformed the country into a democratic socialist utopia. In reality, racism, sexism, and economic inequality are as virulent as ever, and a band of radicals—led by Black, lesbian, and working-class women—join forces to fight back. Told through a furiously fractured, kinetically edited flurry of television news broadcasts, pirate radio transmissions, agitprop, and protests shot guerrilla-style on the streets of New York City, BORN IN FLAMES is a shock wave of feminist futurism that’s both an essential document of its time and radically ahead of it."

Inspired by a scandalous true story, BOY follows ten-year-old Toshio (Tetsuo Abe, an orphan whose real life mirrored the tumultuous upbringing of his character) whose grifter parents use him as a pawn in a scheme to stage car accidents and then extort money from the drivers. As the family crisscrosses Japan in an increasingly desperate attempt to elude the law, Toshio escapes into an imaginary world of science-fiction fantasy and space aliens that he dreams will deliver him from his harrowing existence. Applying the blistering stylistic experimentation of his earlier Japanese New Wave touchstones with newfound restraint, Oshima adopts a relatively sober docudrama approach that proves no less shocking and subversive in its emotionally annihilating portrait of a stolen childhood."

Alighting not on milestones but on the small, in-between moments that make up lives, Linklater fashions a flawlessly acted, often funny portrait that flows effortlessly from one year to the next.

Through an intricate play of flashbacks and shifting perspectives, BRIEF ENCOUNTERS reveals the tangled romantic triangle that connects a hard-nosed city planner (played by Muratova herself), her free-spirited geologist husband (legendary Soviet protest singer Vladimir Vysotskiy), and the young woman from the countryside (Nina Ruslanova) whom she hires as her housekeeper. Blending observational realism with striking New Wave–style experimentation, Muratova crafts a wryly perceptive study of two very different women bound by chance and each navigating her own career, dreams, and disappointments."

Errol Morris turns his camera on one of the most fascinating men in the world: the pioneering astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, afflicted by a debilitating motor neuron disease that has left him without a voice or the use of his limbs. An adroitly crafted tale of personal adversity, professional triumph, and cosmological inquiry, Morris’s documentary examines the way the collapse of Hawking’s body has been accompanied by the untrammeled broadening of his imagination. Telling the man’s incredible story through the voices of his colleagues and loved ones, while making dynamically accessible some of the theories in Hawking’s best-selling book of the same name, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME is at once as small as a single life and as big as the ever-expanding universe."

Directed by Edward Yang • 1991 • Taiwan
Starring Chang Chen, Lisa Yang, Chang Kuo-hu

Among the most praised and sought-after titles in all contemporary film, this singular masterpiece of Taiwanese cinema, directed by Edward Yang, finally comes to home video in the United States. Set in the early sixties in Taiwan, A BRIGHTER SUMMER DAY is based on the true story of a crime that rocked the nation. A film of both sprawling scope and tender intimacy, this novelistic, patiently observed epic centers on the gradual, inexorable fall of a young teenager (Chen Chang, in his first role) from innocence to juvenile delinquency, and is set against a simmering backdrop of restless youth, rock and roll, and political turmoil.

Restored in 2009 by the Cineteca di Bologna/L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, in association with The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project, the Central Motion Picture Corporation, and the Edward Yang Estate. Scan performed at Digimax laboratories in Taipei. Restoration funded by Armani, Cartier, Qatar Airways, and Qatar Museum Authority."

At the height of his international acclaim, Ingmar Bergman followed two meditations on death, THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES, with an examination of the mystery and pain of birth. This intimate chamber drama, set in a maternity ward, follows the emotional crises of three women as they grapple with motherhood. Another major success for the director that was also recognized for its exquisite performances by Ingrid Thulin, Eva Dahlbeck, and Bibi Andersson, BRINK OF LIFE is one of Bergman’s most brilliantly nuanced explorations of the inner lives of women."

How these two story lines connect is the shocking and grotesque secret of this bloody tale of monstrous parenthood from David Cronenberg, starring Oliver Reed and Samantha Eggar.

Diminished by poor health, a crumbling marriage, and the derision of his pupils, the once brilliant scholar is compelled to reexamine his life when a young student offers an unexpected gesture of kindness.

As hard-hitting as its title, BRUTE FORCE was the first of Jules Dassin’s forays into the crime genre, a prison melodrama that takes a critical look at American society as well. Burt Lancaster is the timeworn Joe Collins, who, along with his fellow inmates, lives under the heavy thumb of the sadistic, power-tripping guard Captain Munsey (a riveting Hume Cronyn). Only Collins’s dreams of escape keep him going, but how can he possibly bust out of Munsey’s chains? Matter-of-fact and ferocious, BRUTE FORCE builds to an explosive climax that shows the lengths men will go to when fighting for their freedom."

Traveling from the streets of Havana to the stage of Carnegie Hall, this revelatory documentary captures a forgotten generation of Cuba’s brightest musical talents as they enjoy an unexpected encounter with world fame. The veteran vocalists and instru­mentalists collaborated with American guitarist and roots-music champion Ry Cooder to form the Buena Vista Social Club, playing a jazz-inflected mix of cha-cha, mambo, bolero, and other traditional Latin American styles, and recording an album that won a Grammy and made them an international phenomenon. In the wake of this success, director Wim Wenders filmed the ensemble’s members—including golden-voiced Ibrahim Ferrer and piano virtuoso Rubén González—in a series of illuminating interviews and live performances. The result is one of the most beloved documentaries of the 1990s, and an infectious ode to a neglected corner of Cuba’s prerevolutionary heritage."

An Imperial Japanese Army regiment surrenders to British forces in Burma at the close of World War II and finds harmony through song. A private, thought to be dead, disguises himself as a Buddhist monk and stumbles upon spiritual enlightenment. THE BURMESE HARP is an eloquent meditation on beauty coexisting with death and remains one of Japanese cinema’s most overwhelming antiwar statements, both tender and brutal in its grappling with Japan’s wartime legacy."

Starring Cassie McFarlane, Victor Romero Evans, Beverley Martin

Made in 1981, the first feature by the pioneering Barbados-born British filmmaker Menelik Shabazz marked a coming-of-age for Black British cinema. This hard-edged, wholly absorbing romantic drama traces the emotional and political growth of a young Black woman in Thatcher-era London–viewers may recognize locations and styles from Steve McQueen’s 2020 period series SMALL AXE–charting her journey to emotional maturity, emancipation, and political awakening. Pat Williams (the luminous Cassie McFarlane) has a caring family, her own flat, and a job that she enjoys. She looks forward to settling down to a comfortable married life, but her dream is shattered when she meets Del (Victor Romero), a charming yet vaguely discontented toolmaker, who soon moves in and then loses his job, causing them both to reconsider their assumptions about each other and their aspirations."

As she takes a moment of solace to make the popular Caribbean dessert burnt milk, she is flooded with powerful sense memories that take her back home—visualized by director Joseph Douglas Elmhirst in an intoxicating head rush of ecstatically evocative, stream-of-consciousness imagery."

Made up of intimate, revelatory footage of the singular author and poet filmed over the course of five years, Howard Brookner’s 1983 documentary about William S. Burroughs was for decades mainly the stuff of legend; that changed when Aaron Brookner, the late director’s nephew, discovered a print of it in 2011 and spearheaded a restoration. Now viewers can enjoy the invigorating candidness of BURROUGHS: THE MOVIE, a one-of-a-kind nonfiction portrait that was brought to life with the help of a remarkable crew of friends, including Jim Jarmusch and Tom DiCillo, and that features on-screen appearances by fellow artists of Burroughs’s including Allen Ginsberg, Herbert Huncke, Patti Smith, and Terry Southern."

Entering American society in a time of cultural upheaval and racial tension, Okpokam is seen by others through the prism of American racism and exoticism. Truth is stranger than fiction in BUSHMAN, a rare sort of film portrait, part document, part imagined, and poetic in its approach to real events."

Firstborn Lorens (Phillip Salvador) toils the land by buffalo while Ellis (Christopher de Leon), the apple of his mother&#39;s eye, is given a university education in Manila. When the latter returns to the family’s hacienda with a metropolitan fiancée (Carmi Martin) in tow, the domineering Señora Pina (Mona Lisa) immediately disapproves.

The toads adapted beautifully to their new surroundings. Problem was, the beetle could fly and they couldn’t.

Director Felipe Cazals adopts a gritty documentary style to narrate the events in CANOA while referencing the climate of political repression that would lead to the massacre of student protesters in Mexico City shortly thereafter.

Starring Sylvie Testud, Stanislas Merhar, Olivia Bonamy

Adapting the fifth volume of Marcel Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time,” Chantal Akerman transforms the material into a mesmerizing study of voyeurism, control, and sexual obsession centered on the relationship between a possessive young man (Stanislas Merhar) and his passive lover (Sylvie Testud), whom he is convinced is carrying on a lesbian affair. As he relentlessly stalks her every move, the two find themselves imprisoned in a cycle of jealousy, erotic longing, and self-destruction."

Starring Marino Masé, Patrice Moullet, Geneviève Galéa

Coscripted by Roberto Rossellini, Jean-Luc Godard’s fifth feature is not only a caustic antiwar satire, but a surreally subversive deconstruction of the very idea of the war film that anticipates the director’s late-1960s transition into explicitly political filmmaking. Enticed by promises of riches and glory, a pair of naive brothers, Ulysses (Marino Masé) and Michelangelo (Patrice Moullet), enlist to join a world war, adapting disturbingly easily to their newfound tasks of looting and pillaging. But what happens when it’s time to go home?"

Made by industrial filmmakers on a small budget, the eerily effective B-movie classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS was intended to have “the look of a Bergman and the feel of a Cocteau”—and, with its strikingly used locations and spooky organ score, it succeeds.

The debut feature from Australian New Wave legend Peter Weir is a brilliantly original blend of cracked comedy and macabre horror that Stanley Kubrick selected as one his all-time favorite films. Woe be to any outsider who inadvertently stumbles upon the insular outback town of Paris, where the strange citizens subsist through a most unusual economy: deliberately causing car accidents and then salvaging the wreckage for profit. Survivors, if there are any, are similarly harvested for medical experiments. But not all is well in Paris. One unwilling resident (Terry Camilleri) senses something amiss, while the town’s teenage youths have begun a disturbing revolt of their own."

When the cat reveals the villagers as they really are and the town descends into whimsical chaos, humorless school principal Karel (Jiří Sovák) vows to hunt down the feline and put an end to its anarchic reign.

Having set his first two features on seaside holidays, Jacques Rozier used the third, THE CASTAWAYS OF TURTLE ISLAND, to mock the tourist industry and the “going native” movement that was then increasing in popularity among Western vacationers. Things quickly go south when travel agents Jean-Arthur (Pierre Richard) and Joël (Maurice Risch) offer a fend-for-yourself getaway on a deserted island, with their agency making them accompany clients through deep jungle and across barely charted waters to reach a destination that could give Robinson Crusoe a run for his money. Joël enlists younger brother Bernard (Jacques Villeret) to go in his place, but Jean-Arthur isn’t so lucky, and soon devolves into a semimad purist who will settle for nothing less than the ultimate in survivalist adventure; meanwhile, a motley crew of sightseers becomes divided over how real this shipwreck holiday should be. Far ahead of its time in its satirical targets and its mixing of disparate narrative tones, TURTLE ISLAND is a hilarious comic send-up that could only have emerged from Rozier’s puckish imagination."

Attempts to recapture her fail, provoking further division and eventual war between the animistic Ceddo and the fundamentalist Muslims, with Christian missionaries and slave traders from Europe also playing a role in the conflict.

On a wealthy man’s sixtieth birthday, a sprawling group of family and friends convenes at his country estate for a celebration that soon spirals into bedlam, as bombshell revelations threaten to tear away the veneer of bourgeois respectability and expose the traumas roiling beneath. The dynamic handheld camera work, grainy natural lighting, cacophonous diegetic sound, and raw performance style that would become Dogme hallmarks enhance the shattering visceral impact of this caustic indictment of patriarchal failings, which swings between blackest comedy and bleakest tragedy as it turns the sick soul of a family inside out."

The result is one of the most exuberantly inventive and utterly enchanting films of the French New Wave, in which Julie (Labourier), a daydreaming librarian, meets Céline (Berto), an enigmatic magician, and together they become the heroines of a time-warping adventure involving a haunted house, psychotropic candy, and a murder-mystery melodrama.

Obsessed with the movies he wasn’t allowed to see growing up, Ehsan becomes Ahmad’s closest collaborator in the underground cinematheque, risking arrest and torture in the fight against cultural repression, before escaping to a new life in London.

Starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Isabelle Huppert, Jacqueline Bisset

Claude Chabrol’s forty-ninth feature stands as the crowning achievement of his prolific career—a coolly riveting study of class dynamics, the psychology of crime, and the sordid secrets lurking beneath the veneer of everyday life. A fascinatingly enigmatic, César Award–winning Isabelle Huppert is the chaotic yin to Sandrine Bonnaire’s tightly coiled yang. They are, respectively, a small-town postal worker and a maid to a wealthy family, a pair of outsiders who form a mysterious alliance that gradually, almost imperceptibly, goes haywire. With a master’s control of sound, editing, and suspense, Chabrol constructs a tour de force of sustained tension that delivers each brilliant shock with ice-pick precision."

Starring Kenzo Kawarasaki, Atsuko Kaku, Atsuo Nakamura

One of the greatest and most subversive films by renegade director Nagisa Oshima launches a scathing attack on postwar Japanese society via a portrait of one family, the Sakurada clan, whose increasingly desperate attempts to maintain an outward veneer of respectability mask a pathological history of incest, xenophobic nationalism, failure, and humiliation. Their decline is portrayed via a procession of weddings and funerals that, in their perversity and air of suffocating dread, unfold as a radical rejoinder to the well-worn conventions of the Japanese family melodrama."

Starring Laura Dern, Kristen Stewart, Michelle Williams

The expanses of the American West take center stage in this intimately observed triptych from Kelly Reichardt. Adapted from three short stories by Maile Meloy and unfolding in self-contained but interlocking episodes, CERTAIN WOMEN navigates the subtle shifts in personal desire and social expectation that unsettle the circumscribed lives of its characters: a lawyer (Laura Dern) forced to subdue a troubled client; a wife and mother (Michelle Williams) whose plans to construct her dream home reveal fissures in her marriage; and a night-school teacher (Kristen Stewart) who forms a tenuous bond with a lonely ranch hand (Lily Gladstone), whose longing for connection delivers an unexpected jolt of emotional immediacy. With unassuming craft, Reichardt captures the rhythms of daily life in small-town Montana through these fine-grained portraits of women trapped within the landscape’s wide-open spaces."

In Jem Cohen’s mesmerizing blend of narrative and documentary observation, actual malls, theme parks, hotels, and corporate centers worldwide are joined into a monolithic “superlandscape” that shapes and circumscribes the lives of two women. One is a Japanese businesswoman (Miho Nikaido) researching international theme parks for her company. The other is a young drifter (Mira Billotte) illegally living and working on the fringes of a shopping mall. Though seemingly disconnected, each is similarly impacted by the environment around her."

When her husband’s poet cousin (Soumitra Chatterjee) comes to stay with them, Charulata finds herself both creatively inspired and dangerously drawn to him.

A hypnotically stylized murder mystery awash in period atmosphere, CHESS OF THE WIND unfolds inside a candlelit mansion, where a web of greed, violence, and betrayal ensnares potential heirs as they vie for control of their matriarch’s estate. Melding the influences of European modernism, gothic horror, and classical Persian art, Mohammad Reza Aslani crafts an exquisitely restrained mood piece that erupts into a subversive final act in which class conventions, gender roles, and time itself are upended with shocking ferocity."

A meal of chicken with peppers, which reminds her of the dish her father used to make. But with a general strike closing stores all across town and pushing people into the streets, this innocent request quickly leads to an outrageous series of events that spirals out of control, as Paulette does everything she can to keep her promise and find a chicken for Linda. Directors Chiara Malta and Sébastien Laudenbach unleash a unique visual marvel of hand-painted animation with bright, color-blocked characters, and a story that blends slapstick comedy, musical, and family drama, as Paulette and Linda ultimately confront the grief of an unspoken tragedy through the meal that could finally bring them closer together."

Michel Simon cuts a tragic figure as an unhappily married cashier and amateur painter who becomes so smitten with a prostitute that he refuses to see the obvious: that she and her pimp boyfriend are taking advantage of him.

The crowning achievement of Orson Welles’s extraordinary cinematic career, CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT was the culmination of the filmmaker’s lifelong obsession with Shakespeare’s ultimate rapscallion, Sir John Falstaff. Usually a comic supporting figure, Falstaff—the loyal, often soused friend of King Henry IV’s wayward son Prince Hal—here becomes the focus: a robustly funny and ultimately tragic screen antihero played by Welles with looming, lumbering grace. Integrating elements from both “Henry IV” plays as well as “Richard II,” “Henry V,” and “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” Welles created a gritty and unorthodox Shakespeare film as a lament, he said, “for the death of Merrie England.” Poetic, philosophical, and visceral—with a kinetic centerpiece battle sequence that rivals anything in the director’s body of work—CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT is as monumental as the figure at its heart."

In Ming Dynasty China, an Emperor (Chang Chen) and a princess (Faye Wong), both desperate for the life of a free-spirited wanderer, attempt to escape from the royal palace. The princess, disguised as a man, finds herself attracting the attention of a boorish restaurant owner (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), precipitating much gender- and genre-bending mayhem."

Claire Denis drew on her own childhood experiences growing up in colonial French Africa for her multilayered, languorously absorbing feature debut, which explores many of the themes that would recur throughout her work. Returning to the town where she grew up in Cameroon after many years living in France, a white woman (Mireille Perrier) reflects on her relationship with Protée (Isaach De Bankolé), a Black servant with whom she formed a friendship while not fully grasping the racial divides that governed their worlds."

For his acclaimed follow-up to MAN PUSH CART, Ramin Bahrani once again turned his camera on a slice of New York City rarely seen on-screen: Willets Point, Queens, an industrial sliver of automotive-repair shops that remains perpetually at risk of being redeveloped off the map. It’s within this precarious ecosystem that twelve-year-old Ale (Alejandro Polanco) must grow up fast, hustling in the neighborhood chop shops to build a more stable life for himself and his sister (Isamar Gonzales), even as their tenuous circumstances force each to compete with other struggling people and make desperate decisions. A deeply human story of a fierce but fragile sibling bond being tested by hardscrabble reality, CHOP SHOP tempers its sobering authenticity with flights of lyricism and hope."

Starring Natja Brunckhorst, Thomas Haustein, Jens Kuphal

Adapted from actor and musician Christiane Felscherinow’s harrowing account of her teenage years, CHRISTIANE F. depicts the impact of West Berlin’s 1970s heroin epidemic on one of its youngest and luckiest survivors. On the cusp of fourteen, David Bowie–worshipping Christiane (Natja Brunckhorst) begins slipping out from under the watch of her divorced mother and spending time at the trendy discotheque Sound. There she falls in love with Detlev (Thomas Haustein), whose recent experiments with heroin soon have her hooked. Working with first-time actors and shooting on location with real-life regulars of Zoo Station’s notorious drug scene, director Uli Edel unflinchingly captures the degradation of each phase of junkie life, from the brutal withdrawals to the seemingly endless vows to “go straight.” Bowie himself appears in a concert performance of “Station to Station,” and the film’s soundtrack is both a virtual compendium of the epochal musician’s celebrated Berlin period and a perfect sonic evocation of nightclubbing’s dark side."

Few films can claim as much influence on the course of cinema history as CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER. The fascinating result of a collaboration between filmmaker-anthropologist Jean Rouch and sociologist Edgar Morin, this vanguard work of what Morin termed cinéma- vérité is a brilliantly conceived and realized sociopolitical diagnosis of the early sixties in France. Simply by interviewing a group of Paris residents in the summer of 1960—beginning with the provocative and eternal question “Are you happy?” and expanding to political issues, including the ongoing Algerian War—Rouch and Morin reveal the hopes and dreams of a wide array of people, from artists to factory workers, from an Italian émigré to an African student. CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER’s penetrative approach gives us a document of a time and place with extraordinary emotional depth."

In the last film he made during the silent era, Charlie Chaplin revels in the art of the circus, paying tribute to the acrobats and pantomimists who inspired his virtuoso pratfalls. After being mistaken for a pickpocket, Chaplin’s Tramp flees into the ring of a traveling circus and soon becomes the star of the show, falling for the troupe’s bareback rider along the way. Despite its famously troubled production, this gag-packed comedy ranks among Chaplin’s finest, thanks to some of the most audacious set pieces of the director-performer’s career, including a close brush with a lion and a climactic tightrope walk with a barrelful of monkeys. THE CIRCUS, which was rereleased in 1969 with a new score by Chaplin, is an uproarious high-wire act that showcases silent cinema’s most popular entertainer at the peak of his comic powers."

This graceful, deeply atmospheric short follows Booker (Barrington Darius) as he returns to South Central LA after several years away. Confined to the interior of his car, we watch as he interacts with the people and places he once knew, floating between moments of nostalgia and the subtle realities of a subconscious search for identity. Drawing visual and tonal inspiration from the work of Chantal Akerman, director Dwayne LeBlanc crafts a tender and tactile snapshot of a life in transition."

“Why would I tie myself to one woman?” asks Jerôme in CLAIRE’S KNEE, though he plans to marry a diplomat’s daughter by summer’s end. He spends his July at a lakeside boardinghouse, nursing crushes on the sixteen-year-old Laura and, more tantalizingly, her long-legged, blonde, older half sister, Claire. Baring her knee on a ladder under a blooming cherry tree, Claire unwittingly incites a moral crisis for Jerôme while creating an image that is both the iconic emblem of Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales and one of French cinema’s most enduring moments."

Starring Nurul Haque, Russell Farazi, Jayanto Chattopadhyay

Set during the turbulent late-1960s period leading up to Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan, this lyrical drama tells the story of a family torn apart by religion and war. Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu), a shy young boy from rural East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), is sent away by his father, an orthodox Muslim, to a madrassa, or Islamic school. Far from his family and the warmth of his region’s Hindu festivities, Anu struggles to adapt to the school’s harsh monastic life. As the political divisions in the country intensify, a widening split develops between the moderate and extremist forces within the madrasah and within Anu’s own family. Touching upon themes of religious tolerance, cultural diversity, and the complexity of Islam, THE CLAY BIRD has universal relevance in a crisis-ridden world."

As the investigation proceeds, Michel befriends the police inspector (Jean Rochefort) in charge of his son’s case. Based on a novel by Georges Simenon, THE CLOCKMAKER OF ST. PAUL (a.k.a.

She watches helplessly as her own hopes and desires are pushed aside time and again by those of her siblings and parents, until all her chances for happiness evaporate, leaving her crushed and ailing. Experimenting with off-balance compositions, discontinuous editing, and a densely layered soundtrack, Ghatak devised an intellectually ambitious and emotionally devastating new shape for the melodrama, lamenting the tragedies of Indian history and the inequities of traditional gender roles while blazing a formal trail for the generations of Indian filmmakers who have followed him."

The always extraordinary Juliette Binoche is stirring as Maria, a stage and screen icon who is being courted to star in a new production of the play that made her famous—only this time she must assume the role of the older woman. Kristen Stewart matches her punch for punch as her beleaguered assistant, called upon to provide support both professional and emotional for her mercurial boss. And Chloë Grace Moretz is Maria’s callow new castmate, a starlet waiting in the wings. An amorphous, soul-searching tale, filled with ethereal images of its Swiss Alps setting, CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA brilliantly dramatizes one woman’s reckoning with herself and the world."

Composed almost entirely of brilliantly shot, single-take vignettes focusing on characters connected to one seemingly minor incident on a Paris street, Haneke’s film—with an outstanding international cast headlined by Juliette Binoche—is a revelatory examination of racial inequality and the failure of communication in an increasingly diverse modern landscape."

Drawing from his own youthful experiences, Assayas revisits the outskirts of Paris in the early 1970s, telling the story of teenage lovers Gilles (Cyprien Fouquet) and Christine (Virginie Ledoyen), whose rebellions against family and society threaten to tear them apart. The visceral realism of the movie’s narrative and the near experimentalism of its camera work come together effortlessly thanks in part to a rock soundtrack that vividly evokes the period.

The film’s tapestry of folklore and metaphor departed from the realism that dominated the Soviet cinema of its era, leading authorities to block its distribution, with rare underground screenings presenting it in a restructured form.

Rather than the adventure and glory he envisioned, what he finds is a waking nightmare of unimaginable carnage and cruelty—rendered with a feverish, otherworldly intensity by Klimov’s subjective camera work and expressionistic sound design.

As in his previous docufiction landmark ON THE BOWERY, Rogosin immersed himself in the world of his subjects, in this case in the Black cultural hub of Sophiatown, a vibrant center of music, art, literature, and politics that was soon to be razed by the government to make way for a whites-only suburb. Largely improvised by a nonprofessional cast that includes legendary singer and activist Miriam Makeba, Come Back, Africa reveals both the cruelty of apartheid and the vitality of a community struggling for equality."

A mysterious writer of poison-pen letters, known only as Le Corbeau (the Raven), plagues a French provincial town, unwittingly exposing the collective suspicion and rancor seething beneath the community’s calm surface. Made during the Nazi Occupation of France, Henri-Georges Clouzot’s LE CORBEAU was attacked by the right-wing Vichy regime, the left-wing Resistance press, and the Catholic Church, and it was banned after the Liberation. But some—including Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre—recognized the powerful subtext to Clouzot’s anti-informant, anti-Gestapo fable, and worked to rehabilitate Clouzot’s directorial reputation after the war. LE CORBEAU brilliantly captures a spirit of paranoid pettiness and self-loathing turning an occupied French town into a twentieth-century Salem."

Starring Tatiana Samoilova, Alexei Batalov, Vasily Merkuryev

This landmark film by the virtuosic Mikhail Kalatozov was heralded as a revelation in the post-Stalin Soviet Union and the international cinema community alike. It tells the story of Veronica (Tatiana Samoilova) and Boris (Alexei Batalov), a couple who are blissfully in love until World War II tears them apart. With Boris at the front, Veronica must try to ward off spiritual numbness and defend herself from the increasingly forceful advances of her beau’s draft-dodging cousin. Winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, THE CRANES ARE FLYING is a superbly crafted drama with impassioned performances and viscerally emotional, gravity-defying cinematography by Kalatozov’s regular collaborator Sergei Urusevsky."

Two brothers compete for the amorous favors of a young woman during a seaside summer of gambling, boating, and drinking, in this seminal Sun Tribe (taiyozoku) film from director Kô Nakahira. Adapted from the controversial novel by Shintarô Ishihara, and critically savaged for its lurid portrayal of the postwar sexual revolution among Japan’s young and privileged, CRAZED FRUIT is an anarchic outcry against tradition and the older generation."

One of Agnès Varda least-seen films is also one of her most fascinating: an eccentrically imaginative science-fiction fantasia that touches on human nature, free will, and the creative process. Working with major stars for the first time on a feature film, Varda casts Michel Piccoli as a writer and Catherine Deneuve as his silent wife, a couple who relocate to the island of Noirmoutier (a longtime second home for Varda and her husband, Jacques Demy) where strange goings-on hint at a sinister force controlling the minds and actions of the residents. Slipping between “reality” and fiction, genre spectacle and avant-garde experimentation, LES CRÉATURES (“The Creatures”) is a beguiling, endlessly inventive exploration of the mysterious alchemy that transforms life into art."

Czechoslovak New Wave iconoclast Juraj Herz’s terrifying, darkly comic vision of the horrors of totalitarian ideologies stars a supremely chilling Rudolf Hrušínský as the pathologically morbid Karel Kopfrkingl, a crematorium manager in 1930s Prague who believes fervently that death offers the only true relief from human suffering. When he is recruited by the Nazis, Kopfrkingl’s increasingly deranged worldview drives him to formulate his own shocking final solution. Blending the blackest of gallows humor with disorienting expressionistic flourishes—queasy point-of-view shots, distorting lenses, jarring quick cuts—the controversial, long-banned masterpiece THE CREMATOR is one of cinema’s most trenchant and disturbing portraits of the banality of evil."

Carlos Saura’s exquisite CRÍA CUERVOS . . . heralded a turning point in Spain: shot while General Franco was on his deathbed, the film melds the personal and the political in a portrait of the legacy of fascism and its effects on a middle-class family (the title derives from the Spanish proverb: “Raise ravens and they&#39;ll peck out your eyes” Ana Torrent (the dark-eyed beauty from THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE) portrays the disturbed eight-year-old Ana, living in Madrid with her two sisters and mourning the death of her mother, whom she conjures as a ghost (an ethereal Geraldine Chaplin).

This existential wail of a drama concerns two sisters, Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann), keeping vigil for a third, Agnes (Harriet Andersson), who is dying of cancer and can find solace only in the arms of a beatific servant (Kari Sylwan). An intensely felt film that is one of Bergman’s most striking formal experiments, CRIES AND WHISPERS (which won an Oscar for the extraordinary color photography by Sven Nykvist) is a powerful depiction of human behavior in the face of death, positioned on the borders between reality and nightmare, tranquility and terror."

An oft-overlooked jewel from Jean Renoir, this exuberant ode to working-class solidarity is both one of the director’s most thoroughly charming works as well as one of his most sly political statements. Channeling the collectivist, utopian spirit of the Popular Front movement, THE CRIME OF MONSIEUR LANGE combines comedy with thriller elements to tell the story of a publishing house where the exploited employees form a collective following the sudden death of their tyrannical boss. When the supposedly dead man unexpectedly returns, a mild-mannered writer of Western serials (René Lefèvre) takes matters into his own hands."

The eighteen-year-old Nelly (Inga Landgré), who lives with her foster mother in a quiet provincial town, is shaken by the sudden arrival of her birth mother (Marianne Löfgren), who eventually takes her to Stockholm—where Nelly receives a crash course in corruption and wrenching heartbreak.

Set amid the scenic splendor of the French Riviera in autumn, DADDY NOSTALGIA is an elegiac meditation on family and mortality from one of cinema’s most sensitive humanists."

Spending most of her days at home following the birth of her son but curious as ever about the people and places that surrounded her, Agnès Varda found inspiration for DAGUERRÉOTYPES just outside her door: on Paris’s rue Daguerre, where she had lived and worked since the 1950s. The director turns her camera on the business owners whose shops are the street’s lifeblood: bakers, tailors, butchers, perfumers, music-store clerks, driving instructors, and others, who, between the everyday rituals of their work, talk of their lives, relationships, and dreams. Blending her photographer’s eye for still portraiture with her filmmaker’s gift for finding visual rhymes and resonances between images, Varda reveals the rich social fabric of an entire world—all without leaving her block."

If the entire world is bad, why shouldn’t we be? Adopting this insolent attitude as their guiding philosophy, a pair of hedonistic young women (Ivana Karbanová and Jitka Cerhová), both named Marie, embark on a gleefully debauched odyssey of gluttony, giddy destruction, and antipatriarchal resistance, in which nothing is safe from their nihilistic pursuit of pleasure. But what happens when the fun is over? Matching her anarchic message with an equally radical aesthetic, director Věra Chytilová, with the close collaboration of cinematographer Jaroslav Kučera, unleashes an optical storm of fluctuating film stocks, kaleidoscopic montages, cartoonish stop-motion cutouts, and surreal costumes designed by Ester Krumbachová, who also cowrote the script.

Starring Tim Moore, Andrew Trible, Amon Davis

As a filmmaker, Oscar Micheaux was something of a firebrand, but his attitudes and methods were anything but predictable—often leveling criticism at certain strata of the African American community. His most outrageous film is a traditional minstrel show—an olio of broad comedy and choral interludes. It is an acknowledgement of minstrelsy as a defining tradition of African American stage performance (see also the blackface routines in Micheaux’s TEN MINUTES TO LIVE). If nothing else, THE DARKTOWN REVUE is an invaluable historical document for recording on film the “Hard Shell Sermon” routine popularized by turn-of-the-century minstrel performer Amon Davis. But there is something else. True to form, Micheaux’s depiction of a minister is not flattering. Davis’s comic sermon of gibberish is a scathing satire of charismatic religion, made even more troubling by the fact that it is performed by a black man in blackface. By the same token, one cannot help but wonder if Micheaux was further provoking his audience by having the uplifting Donald Heywood choir open the film with a rendition of “Watermelon Time.”"

He delivers an intense performance as Ragab, a sailor who must leave behind his beloved Hamidah (Faten Hamama, at the time Sharif’s real-life wife) for a long voyage at sea.

Rediscovered and restored, this large-scale vision of Comanche and Kiowa life is a revelation. The story, played by a sprawling cast of three hundred Native Americans, includes a romantic rivalry, buffalo hunts, a battle, village scenes, dances, deceit, courage, hand-to-hand combat, and even a happy ending. The Indigenous actors, who in 1920 had been living on reservations for less than sixty years, brought with them their own tipis, horses, clothing, and material culture.

This bittersweet film from Jean Renoir, based on a story by Guy de Maupassant, is a tenderly comic idyll about a city family’s picnic in the French countryside and the romancing of the mother and grown daughter by two local men. Conceived as a short feature, the project had nearly finished production in 1936 when Renoir was called away for THE LOWER DEPTHS. Shooting was abandoned then, but the film was completed with the existing footage by Renoir’s team and released in its current form in 1946, after the director had already moved on to Hollywood.

The initial entry in a loosely connected, ongoing cycle that includes IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE and 2046, this ravishing existential reverie is a dreamlike drift through the Hong Kong of the 1960s in which a band of wayward twentysomethings—including a disaffected playboy (Leslie Cheung Kwok Wing) searching for his birth mother, a lovelorn woman (Maggie Cheung Man Yuk) hopelessly enamored with him, and a policeman (Andy Lau Tak Wah) caught in the middle of their turbulent relationship—pull together and push apart in a dance of frustrated desire. The director’s inaugural collaboration with both cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who lends the film its gorgeously gauzy, hallucinatory texture, and actor Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who appears briefly in a tantalizing teaser for a never-realized sequel, DAYS OF BEING WILD is an exhilarating first expression of Wong’s trademark themes of time, longing, dislocation, and the restless search for human connection."

Starring Parker Posey, Hope Davis, Liev Schreiber

With its droll humor and bittersweet emotional heft, the feature debut of writer-director Greg Mottola announced the arrival of an unassumingly sharp-witted new talent on the 1990s indie film scene. When she discovers a love letter written to her husband (Stanley Tucci) by an unknown paramour, the distraught Eliza (Hope Davis) turns to her tight-knit Long Island family for advice. Soon the entire clan—strong-willed mom (Anne Meara), taciturn dad (Pat McNamara), and jaded sister (Parker Posey) with pretentious boyfriend (Liev Schreiber) in tow—has squeezed into a station wagon and headed into Manhattan to find out the truth, kicking off a one-crazy-day odyssey full of unexpected detours and life-changing revelations. Performed with deadpan virtuosity by a top-flight ensemble cast, THE DAYTRIPPERS is a wry and piercing look at family bonds stretched to the breaking point."

Bill Williams stars as Alex, a sailor whose troubles begin when he wakes up with only dim memories of where or what he was drinking the night before and discovers a mysterious $1,400 in his pocket.

With DEAD MAN, his first period piece, Jim Jarmusch imagined the nineteenth-century American West as an existential wasteland, delivering a surreal reckoning with the ravages of industrialization, the country&#39;s legacy of violence and prejudice, and the natural cycle of life and death. Accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) has hardly arrived in the godforsaken outpost of Machine before he&#39;s caught in the middle of a fatal lovers&#39; quarrel. Wounded and on the lam, Blake falls under the watch of the outcast Nobody (Gary Farmer), who guides his companion on a spiritual journey, teaching him to dispense poetic justice along the way. Featuring austerely beautiful black-and-white photography by Robby Müller and a live-wire score by Neil Young, DEAD MAN is a profound and unique revision of the western genre."

In this macabre farce, a Korean man is sentenced to death in Japan but survives his execution, sending the authorities into a panic about what to do next. At once disturbing and oddly amusing, Oshima’s constantly surprising film is a subversive and surreal indictment of both capital punishment and the treatment of Korean immigrants in his country."

The project, however, soon spins off into unexpected directions, first when Inoue is diagnosed with terminal cancer, then when Hara begins to discover that the writer’s talents for fiction extend to his own life, the details of which he has been fabricating for decades. As the ailing author confronts his mortality and races to complete his final works, Hara begins digging into Inoue’s past in an attempt to separate the man from the myth, resulting in a unique, layered portrait of a complex figure whose very life was an extension of his art."

Nielsen plays Diane de Monx, a Volf Corporation executive turned spy for rival Mangatronics in the companies’ battle over the lucrative market of internet adult animation. But Diane may not be the only player at Volf with a hidden agenda: both romantic interest Hervé (Charles Berling) and office enemy Elise (Chloë Sevigny) seem to know her secret and can easily use it against her for their own purposes. As the stakes grow higher and Diane ventures into deadlier territory, Assayas explores the connections between multinational businesses and extreme underground media as well as the many ways twenty-first-century reality increasingly resembles violent, disorienting fiction."

As a liberal humanist whose ideals were often at odds with the encroaching forces of religious fundamentalism, director Youssef Chahine found rich personal resonances in this urgent and engaging historical panorama, made in reaction to the unprecedented wave of Islamic terrorism that rocked Egypt in the nineties. DESTINY centers on the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher, judge, and polymath Ibn Rushd, commonly known in the West as Averroes. In the Arab-ruled Spanish province of Andalusia, the brilliant Averroës (Nour el-Sherif) lives at the center of a secular, multicultural world of learning and open inquiry—until a sect of extremists set out to suppress everything he represents."

Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer • 1945 • United States
Starring Tom Neal, Ann Savage 

From Poverty Row came a movie that, perhaps more than any other, epitomizes the dark fatalism at the heart of film noir. As he hitchhikes his way from New York to Los Angeles, a down-on-his-luck nightclub pianist (Tom Neal) finds himself with a dead body on his hands and nowhere to run—a waking nightmare that goes from bad to worse when he picks up the most vicious femme fatale in cinema history, Ann Savage’s snarling, monstrously conniving drifter Vera. Working with no-name stars on a bargain-basement budget, B auteur Edgar G. Ulmer turned threadbare production values and seedy, low-rent atmosphere into indelible pulp poetry. Long unavailable in a format in which its hard-boiled beauty could be fully appreciated, DETOUR haunts anew in its first major restoration.

Master filmmaker Satyajit Ray explores the conflict between fanaticism and free will in DEVI (“The Goddess”), issuing a subversively modern challenge to religious orthodoxy and patriarchal power structures. In rural India in the second half of the nineteenth century, after his son (Soumitra Chatterjee) leaves for Kolkata to complete his studies, a wealthy feudal landlord (Chhabi Biswas) is seized by the notion that his beloved daughter-in-law (a hauntingly sad-eyed Sharmila Tagore) is an incarnation of the Mother Goddess—a delusion that proves devastating to the young woman and those around her. The elegantly stylized compositions and the chiaroscuro lighting by cinematographer Subrata Mitra heighten the expressionistic intensity of this domestic tragedy, making for an experience that is both sublime and shattering."

With this Palme d’Or–winning drama, which deftly combines seemingly disparate genres, French filmmaker Jacques Audiard cemented his status as a titan of contemporary world cinema. In an arresting performance, the nonprofessional actor Antonythasan Jesuthasan (himself a former child soldier) stars as a Tamil fighter who, along with a woman and a child posing as his wife and daughter, flees war-torn Sri Lanka only to land in a Paris suburb blighted by drugs. As the makeshift family embarks on a new life, DHEEPAN settles into an intimate social-realist mode before tightening into a dynamic turf-war thriller, as well as an unsettling study of the psychological aftereffects of combat. Searing and sensitive, Audiard’s film is a unique depiction of the refugee experience as a continuous crisis of identity."

Adapted from a novel by Arnošt Lustig, DIAMONDS OF THE NIGHT closely tracks two boys who escape from a concentration-camp transport and flee into the surrounding woods, hostile terrain where the brute realities of survival coexist with dreams, memories, and fragments of visual poetry. Along with visceral camera work by Jaroslav Kučera and Miroslav Ondříček—two of Czechoslovak cinema’s most influential cinematographers—Němec makes inventive use of fractured editing, elliptical storytelling, and flights of surrealism as he strips context away from this bare-bones tale, evoking the panicked delirium of consciousness lost in night and fog."

One of Hungary’s most acclaimed filmmakers, Márta Mészáros, drew on her own wartime experiences to craft this haunting portrait of a young woman coming of age at a turbulent historical moment. After losing her father in the Stalinist purges, strong-willed teenager Juli (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi) is brought back to Hungary to live with Magda (Anna Polony), a rigid Communist Party official who embodies the icy intellectual repression that has begun to take hold in the country. As she navigates an unfamiliar new world—one caught between the shock of World War II and the rising tide of Stalinism—Juli must fight to retain her sense of self.

There, Juli must navigate the bureaucratic propaganda machine that demands she conform to its ideas of “realism” while searching desperately for her missing father. Interweaving its heroine’s journey with the political upheavals of the postwar Eastern Bloc—from the death of Stalin to the short-lived promise of liberalization to the 1956 Hungarian Uprising—DIARY FOR MY LOVERS is a stirring depiction of a young woman finding her voice in a world intent on stifling it."

The heartrending third installment of Márta Mészáros’s autobiographical Diary series continues to trace the journey of Juli (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi), a young orphan, through the tumult of postwar Hungary. Set in the wake of the failed 1956 Hungarian revolution, DIARY FOR MY MOTHER AND FATHER follows Juli as she leaves film school in Moscow and returns home to Budapest, where she discovers a shattered world in which brutality, fear, and anxiety permeate every aspect of life as Soviet forces tighten their grip on power.

The film’s two sections mirror each other: in the first, Michael Lonsdale performs the role of a man explaining to a roomful of friends his past voyeuristic obsessions, while the second section shows an unscripted recording of Jean-Noël Picq, the man Lonsdale plays, recounting the same real-life tale. Eustache presents dramatic and authentic versions of the “dirty story” without authorial commentary and thus encourages the viewer to untangle a web of structural correspondences between the narrations, as well as the sexual and moral implications of Picq’s candid confession."

Droll comedy of manners and morals that was based on a play and made as a film once before in 1932 as COUNSEL&#39;S OPINION, directed by Allan Dwan. The four screenwriters&#39; literate script of Biro&#39;s adaptation of the stage work takes Oberon to a London hotel where she is attending a costume party. The weather turns foul and she must spend the night at the hostelry with several other ladies who were unable to make it home. Olivier is a young lawyer occupying a suite and the manager prevails on him to give up some of the space in his copious quarters, but Olivier is adamant until Oberon uses her wiles on him. The result is that she gets the comfortable bed and Olivier must snooze on the floor in the next room. In the morning, she leaves before he can find out anything about this fascinating and attractive woman. Her alacrity causes him to wonder if she&#39;s married. When he arrives at his office, an old school chum contacts him and wants Olivier to handle his divorce. The man is sure his wife spent the night with another man at the same hotel we&#39;ve seen earlier. Olivier can&#39;t believe this nerd could be married to Oberon. He isn&#39;t, of course, and his wife is someone else entirely. But Olivier doesn&#39;t know that yet. So it gets down to one of those British drawing-room farces where identities are mistaken, accusations are made, absurd situations occur, and Olivier and Oberon are together at the finale. Richardson is very funny as the man who wants a divorce from wife Barnes, who has been married thrice before and has backhanded fidelity on many other occasions. Oberon shows she can play light comedy as well as some of the heavier work she had to do over the years. The Technicolor tinting was supervised by long-time advisor Natalie Kalmus and, although it lent a nice air to the already-airy material, it was totally unnecessary."

This small-scale fiction about a divorced mother and her child (played by Agnès Varda&#39;s own son) leading a quiet existence on L.A.&#39;s margins was made directly after Mur Murs, and though DOCUMENTEUR is different in form and tone from that film, the two are complexly interwoven, with overlapping images and ideas.

Starring Yoshitaka Zushi, Kin Sugai, Junzaburo Ban

By turns tragic and transcendent, Akira Kurosawa’s film follows the daily lives of a group of people barely scraping by in a slum on the outskirts of Tokyo. Yet as desperate as their circumstances are, each of them—the homeless father and son envisioning their dream house; the young woman abused by her uncle; the boy who imagines himself a trolley conductor—finds reasons to carry on. The unforgettable DODES’KA-DEN was made at a tumultuous moment in Kurosawa’s life. And all of his hopes, fears, and artistic passion are on fervent display in this, his gloriously shot first color film."

On a sweltering August day, novice criminals Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) attempt to rob a Brooklyn bank in order to pay for Sonny’s lover’s gender confirmation surgery—a situation that quickly spirals into a tense police standoff and a three-ring media circus. Sidney Lumet’s New York City classic contains what may be the definitive Pacino performance—totally wired, thrillingly unpredictable—and flavorful footage of summer-in-the-city ’70s Brooklyn: you can practically feel the heat rising from the rubble."

An ineffably bittersweet portrait of youth in the 1960s, Nancy Savoca’s funny, sensitive tale of love and war etches two vividly alive characters: aspiring San Francisco folk singer Rose (Lili Taylor) and hotheaded, Vietnam-bound marine Eddie Birdlace (River Phoenix), who meet on the occasion of a cruelly misogynistic party where men compete to bring the most unattractive dates they can find. But what begins as a night to forget unexpectedly develops into something far more meaningful. Featuring music by folk legends Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and Pete Seeger, DOGFIGHT captures the miracle of human connection while gracefully subverting ideas surrounding machismo, patriotic duty, and the very meaning of America itself."

Combining monster-movie mayhem with a rollicking heist subplot results in a uniquely entertaining and offbeat entry in the kaiju canon."

In this wildly entertaining vision of one of the twentieth century’s greatest artists, Dylan is surrounded by teen fans, gets into heated philosophical jousts with journalists, and kicks back with fellow musicians Joan Baez, Donovan, and Alan Price. Featuring some of Dylan’s most famous songs, including “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” and “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” DONT LOOK BACK is a radically conceived portrait of an American icon that has influenced decades of vérité behind-the-scenes documentaries."

A cast of Black stage and screen luminaries including Esther Rolle, Mabel King, and Avon Long stars in this charmingly offbeat, fablelike fantasy in which a pair of mischief-making devil-bats dispatched by Satan assume human form in order to wreak havoc on a Saturday-night house party in Harlem—only to find their diabolical plan thwarted by their hosts’ infectious generosity of spirit. Staged with ebullience, the original blues- and gospel-infused songs by Van Peebles burst forth in a life-affirming celebration of Black joy, tenderness, resilience, and strength."

When they inadvertently link up with a dangerously alluring drifter (Johnathon Schaech), a chilled-out Cali bro (James Duval) and his spiky, foulmouthed girlfriend (Rose McGowan) find themselves on an increasingly violent, kinky, and darkly comic journey in which erotic tensions rise along with the body count. Working with a significant budget for the first time, Araki employs boldly stylized lighting and art direction to create a heightened sense of unreality in a shocking, shoegaze-soundtracked chronicle of young lives careening toward oblivion."

This richly evocative blend of fictional character study and documentary-like observation offers an intimate perspective on the ravages of globalization through an arresting portrait of one woman’s personal and professional battles. Teresa Sánchez (winner of a Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival) delivers an astonishing performance as María García, the owner of Dos Estaciones, a formerly majestic tequila factory now struggling to stay afloat. The factory is the final holdover from generations of Mexican-owned tequila plants in the highlands of Jalisco, the rest having folded to foreign corporations.

Krzysztof Kieślowski’s international breakthrough remains one of his most beloved films, a ravishing, mysterious rumination on identity, love, and human intuition. Irène Jacob is incandescent as both Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, Véronique, a French music teacher. Though unknown to each other, the two women share an enigmatic, emotional bond, which Kieślowski details in gorgeous reflections, colors, and movements.

The chilly landscapes of Helsinki are warmed by the gentle humanism and wry humor of Aki Kaurismäki in the first installment of his FINLAND TRILOGY, a deadpan tale of everyday survival in the face of overwhelming obstacles. Misfortune begets misfortune when, in short order, Lauri (Kari Väänänen) loses his job as a tram driver and the restaurant where his wife, Ilona (Kati Outinen), works announces it is closing to make way for a chain. With few job prospects, the two find themselves facing a crisis that tests the strength of their bond."

Ever calm and patient, Dr. T sees his equanimity tested as his life is rocked by a series of events—his wife (Farrah Fawcett) suffers a breakdown, his daughter (Kate Hudson) has a bombshell secret, his sister-in-law (Laura Dern) won’t stop meddling, and a professional golfer (Helen Hunt) strikes up a new flirtation—that force him to reconsider everything he thought he knew about women."

Winner of the prestigious Golden Bear at the 1964 Berlin International Film Festival, Metin Erksan’s wallop of a melodrama follows the machinations of an unrepentantly selfish tobacco farmer who builds a dam to prevent water from flowing downhill to his neighbors’ crops. Alongside this tale of soul-devouring competition is one of overheated desire, as a love triangle develops between the farmer, his more decent brother, and the beautiful villager the latter takes as his bride. A benchmark of Turkish cinema, this is a visceral, innovatively shot and vibrantly acted depiction of the horrors of greed.

When Lula pushes him to his breaking point, Clay’s furious response appears to provide cathartic liberation—unless it portends a far more tragic fate.

The first Godzilla film directed by Jun Fukuda, who would go on to direct four more, is fast-paced and light in tone, and builds to a riveting race-against-time finale. On a secluded island in the South Seas, a group of castaways stumble upon a paramilitary organization whose nefarious nuclear activities threaten the world at large—and set the stage for kaiju clashes involving Godzilla, Mothra, and the giant crustacean Ebirah."

One of director Werner Herzog’s most unsettling explorations of the madness that can seize men’s hearts, this haunting documentary recounts the reign of Jean-Bédel Bokassa, who ruled for eleven years as the self-declared emperor of the Central African Republic, presiding over a regime of shocking corruption. Told through the eyes of everyone from Bokassa’s wives to his political enemies to a foreign journalist he brutally imprisoned, ECHOES FROM A SOMBER EMPIRE is in some ways one of the director’s more straightforward documentaries—though in true Herzog fashion he makes room for everything from the swarming migration of the Christmas Island red crab to the unforgettable sight of a smoking chimpanzee."

Using the architecture of Rome as a backdrop for the doomed affair, Antonioni achieves the apotheosis of his style in this return to the theme that preoccupied him the most: the difficulty of connection in an alienating modern world."

Starring Luca Marinelli, Alessandro Borghi, Lupo Barbiero

An epic journey of friendship and self-discovery, THE EIGHT MOUNTAINS is a landmark cinematic experience as intimate as it is monumental, as deep as it is expansive. Adapting the award-winning novel by Paolo Cognetti, directors Felix van Groeningen and Charlotte Vandermeersch (THE BROKEN CIRCLE BREAKDOWN) portray through observant detail and stunning landscape photography the profound, complex relationship between Pietro (Luca Marinelli) and Bruno (Alessandro Borghi), who first meet as children when Pietro’s Milan family vacations in an isolated village at the base of the Alpine slopes. As they mature, Pietro becomes estranged from his business-minded father (Filippo Timi) even as Bruno—emotionally abandoned by his own father—takes up the role of surrogate son. Pietro’s father’s death reunites the two in realizing his dream of constructing a cabin on the Alps, and the project and subsequent explorations of the awe-inspiring mountain range bond Pietro and Bruno in a shared purpose. Yet despite their connection, the purity of nature and the demands of society both threaten to drive the men to pursue different, possibly irrevocably divergent paths on the vertiginous terrain of life.

Starring Pia Degermark, Thommy Berggren, Lennart Malmer

Bo Widerberg reached new heights of visual lyricism with this sublime retelling of a real-life nineteenth-century romantic tragedy. Bound by their all-consuming desire, a young circus tightrope walker (Pia Degermark, winner of the Cannes Best Actress prize) and a lieutenant (Tommy Berggren) with a wife and children forsake everything to be together and escape to the countryside—only to see their lovers’ idyll gradually give way to poverty and desperation. With its painterly, sun-dappled images and indelible use of Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 21, this 1960s art-house sensation is the most ravishing expression of Widerberg’s recurring theme of the tension between individual freedom and social responsibility."

One of director Youssef Chahine’s most controversial works ignited a firestorm of criticism from both Islamic and Christian voices, who objected to its liberal reinterpretation of the biblical story of Joseph (here renamed Ram to skirt censorship that forbids the depiction of religious figures). Nevertheless the film proved one of Chahine’s biggest commercial triumphs at home, a passionate evocation of ancient Egypt that uses the story—in which a young dreamer (Khaled el-Nabawy) leaves behind his backwards rural home and sets off to the intellectual center of Egypt on a journey fraught with political and sexual peril—to comment on deeply personal ideas about resistance, sacrifice, and liberation."

With revolutionary outrage, Ousmane Sembène chronicles a period during World War II when French colonial forces in Senegal conscripted young men of the Diola people and attempted to seize rice stores for soldiers back in Europe. As the tribe’s patriarchal leaders pray and make sacrifices to their gods, the women in the community refuse to yield their harvests, incurring the French army’s wrath. With a deep understanding of the oppressive forces that have shaped Senegalese history, EMITAÏ explores the strains that colonialism places upon cultural traditions and, in the process, discovers a people’s hidden reserves of rebellion and dignity."

Of all Paul Robeson’s eleven starring film performances, by far his most iconic was his breakthrough in the big-screen adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’s THE EMPEROR JONES (1933). He was already a legend for his stage incarnation of Brutus Jones, a Pullman porter who powers his way to the rule of a Caribbean island, but with this, his first sound-era film role, his regal image was married to his booming voice for eternity. With THE EMPEROR JONES, Robeson became the first African-American leading man in mainstream movies and, he said, gained a deeper understanding of cinema&#39;s potential to change racial misconceptions.

Made with a righteous political anger that anticipates the incendiary polemics of documentarians such as Michael Moore and Joshua Oppenheimer, Kazuo Hara’s most renowned film is a harrowing confrontation with one of Japanese history’s darkest chapters: the atrocities committed by the country’s military during World War II. Hara’s unforgettable subject and collaborator in THE EMPEROR’S NAKED ARMY MARCHES ON is Kenzo Okuzaki—a former soldier, convicted murderer, and defiantly anti-establishment agitator—who has made it his life’s mission to expose the crimes committed by Japanese officers against their own men while stationed in New Guinea. As the often-violent Okuzaki resorts to extreme measures in his crusade to find out the truth about what happened to two soldiers murdered by their commanders, what emerges is at once a shocking piece of investigative journalism, a courageous condemnation of militarism and blind obedience, and a riveting portrait of a single-minded man driven by a raw fury bordering on madness."

Set in a Japanese village at the end of the nineteenth century, the film details the emotional and physical downfall of a married woman and her younger lover following their decision to murder her husband and dump his body in a well.

Jean Eustache’s final film—commissioned for the French television series “Contes modernes” (“Modern Tales”)—is a sharp satire of contemporary man’s dehumanization at the hands of specialized psychology. In the first half, an unemployed, middle-aged sales director (Michel Delahaye) seeks a job from the want ads and performs well in his interview. In the second half, a handwriting analyst (Michèle Moretti) determines the suitability of each candidate by reading into their cover letters various subconscious weaknesses and faults.

As World War II splits Europe, sixteen-year-old German Jew Salomon (Marco Hofschneider) is separated from his family after fleeing with them to Poland, and finds himself reluctantly assuming various ideological identities in order to hide the deadly secret of his Jewishness. He is bounced from a Soviet orphanage, where he plays a dutiful Stalinist, to the Russian front, where he hides in plain sight as an interpreter for the German army, and back to his home country, where he takes on his most dangerous role: a member of the Hitler Youth. Based on the real-life experiences of Salomon Perel, Agnieszka Holland’s wartime tour de force EUROPA EUROPA is a breathless survival story told with the verve of a comic adventure, an ironic refutation of the Nazi idea of racial purity, and a complex portrait of a young man caught up in shifting historical calamities and struggling to stay alive."

Taking the playfully discursive, intellectually omnivorous approach of Chris Marker’s cine-essays as its model, this first installment, THE SPECTRE OF EUROCOMMUNISM, explores the legacy of the 1970s leftist movement that sought to adapt communism to Western Europe, along the way touching on everything from the theories of Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci to the linguistic idiosyncrasies of James Joyce to the little-known tradition of Italian donkey racing."

One of the defining independent films of the 1990s, Atom Egoyan’s mesmerizing international breakthrough EXOTICA takes the conventions of the psychological thriller into bold new territory—unsettling, dreamlike, and empathetic. At the neon-drenched Toronto strip club of the film’s title, a coterie of lost and damaged souls—including a man haunted by grief, a young woman with whom he shares an enigmatic bond, an obsessive emcee, and a smuggler of rare bird eggs—search for redemption as they work through the traumas of their mysteriously interconnected histories in an obsessive cycle of sex, pain, jealousy, and catharsis. Masterfully weaving together past and present, Egoyan constructs a spellbinding narrative puzzle, the full emotional impact of which doesn’t hit until the last piece is in place."

Starring Parviz Naderi, Hossein Yarmohammadi, Andre Govalovish

Based on a story by Amir Naderi, who also cowrote the film, this slice of a fourteen-year-old boy’s life follows his efforts to fend for himself in the big city, working as a tea server and assistant in a photographer’s studio, running errands, and, briefly, exchanging glances with a pretty middle-class girl. With no music and little dialogue, and distinguished by its darkly elegant compositions, the film offers an impressionistic meditation on adolescent solitude."

When his wife, the outspoken feminist Miyuki Takeda, announced that she was leaving him in order to find herself, Kazuo Hara began this raw, intensely personal documentary as a way to both maintain a connection to the woman he still cared for and to make sense of their complex relationship. Granted at times shockingly intimate access to Miyuki’s personal life, Hara follows her wayward journey toward liberation as she explores her sexuality with both men and women, becomes pregnant and raises a family as a single mother, and grows increasingly disenchanted with the constraints of traditional social structures. A film as radical, complicated, and uncompromising as Miyuki herself, EXTREME PRIVATE EROS explodes the boundaries between subject and filmmaker to create a stunningly candid portrait of a woman willing to risk everything in her quest to live on her own terms."

Unfolding in a fractured, time-shuffling structure, EYE OF GOD traces the fates of two seemingly disconnected individuals—one a lonely waitress (an extraordinary Martha Plimpton) who enters into a relationship with a violent ex-convict, the other a teenage boy (Nick Stahl) whom the police discover late one night, traumatized and bloody—whose lives converge in shocking tragedy."

Visionary cinema historian Mark Cousins (THE STORY OF FILM: AN ODYSSEY) charts the unknown territory of the imagination of one of the twentieth century’s most revolutionary artists. Granted unprecedented access to hundreds of sketches, drawings, and paintings by Orson Welles—tantalizing, never-before-seen glimpses into the filmmaker’s rich inner life—Cousins sheds new light on the experiences, dreams, desires, and obsessions that fueled his creativity and inspired his masterpieces. Playful, profound, and as daringly iconoclastic as its subject, THE EYES OF ORSON WELLES is a one-of-a-kind work of visual archaeology, a fresh way of looking at a cinematic giant whose singular worldview—fiercely humanist, defiantly antiauthoritarian—resonates now more urgently than ever."

EYES WITHOUT A FACE, directed by the supremely talented Georges Franju, is rare in horror cinema for its odd mixture of the ghastly and the lyrical, and it has been a major influence on the genre in the decades since its release. There are images here—of terror, of gore, of inexplicable beauty—that once seen are never forgotten."

Shot on richly textured 16 mm film and infused with the spirit of neorealism, EYIMOFE (THIS IS MY DESIRE) traces the journeys of two distantly connected strangers—Mofe (Jude Akuwudike), an electrician dealing with the fallout of a family tragedy, and Rosa (Temi Ami-Williams), a hairdresser supporting her pregnant teenage sister—as they each pursue their dream of starting a new life in Europe while bumping up against the harsh economic realities of a world in which every interaction is a transaction.

Okuyama (YOJIMBO’s Tatsuya Nakadai), after being burned and disfigured in an industrial accident and estranged from his family and friends, agrees to his psychiatrist’s radical experiment: a face transplant, created from the mold of a stranger. As Okuyama is thus further alienated from the world around him, he finds himself giving in to his darker temptations. With unforgettable imagery, Teshigahara’s film explores both the limits and freedom in acquiring a new persona, and questions the notion of individuality itself."

A breathtakingly intimate romance unfolds against a sweeping backdrop of social upheaval in renowned director Chen Kaige’s sumptuous saga of passion, fate, and the transcendent possibilities of art. Spanning fifty years of twentieth-century Chinese history, FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE follows aspiring actors Dieyi (a heartbreaking Leslie Cheung) and Xiaolou (Zhang Fengyi) as they emerge from a childhood of brutal training to become Beijing-opera stars, with life mirroring art as Dieyi’s unrequited love for Xiaolou and the country’s changing political tides engulf them in their own personal tragedies of jealousy and betrayal. The first Chinese film to win the Palme d’Or is epic filmmaking of the highest order—visually and emotionally ravishing from frame to exquisite frame."

Youssef Chahine’s love for classic Hollywood musicals shines through his own exuberant forays into the genre, including this inventive and offbeat blend of singing, dancing, and melodrama. Beloved singer-stars Farid al-Atrash and Shadia light up the screen as a hard-hearted, terminally ill marine sergeant and the nurse who, in caring for him, gradually falls in love. In only his second musical, Chahine shows his eagerness to experiment with the possibilities of the form as he would continue to do throughout his career."

Midway through his time in Germany, Bergman returned to Fårö for his second documentary exploration of the remote Swedish island he loved and the socio­economic realities experienced by those who lived there. Longer, more optimistic, and less ascetic than its predecessor, this film charts a calendar year in the life of the island’s 673 inhabitants, many of whom he observes working tirelessly shearing sheep, thatching roofs, and slaughtering livestock, as well as going about various communal rituals. Distilled from twenty-eight hours of material, FÅRÖ DOCUMENT 1979 is a lyrical depiction of life’s cyclical nature."

Playful, elegantly crafted, and brimming with some of the most unforgettable images in the director’s filmography, FASCINATION represents Rollin at his very best—venturing outside his usual comfort zones and extending the definition of his filmic universe in the process."

Elena meets Fernando, an Italian law student; he seduces her with promises of love, and the ever watchful Anaïs bears witness to the corruption of her sister’s innocence.

Something like an Egyptian IT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE meets A CHRISTMAS CAROL, the film spins the story of the simple but virtuous clerk Amin (Hussein Riad) who falls for a get-rich-quick scheme that soon goes wrong. When Amin suddenly dies, he observes from the afterlife the consequences of his actions on his struggling family.

As if under the intoxicating influence of the drug itself, FAYA DAYI unfurls as a hallucinogenic cinematic reverie, capturing hushed, intimate moments in the existences of everyone from the harvesters of the crop to people lost in its narcotic haze to a desperate but determined younger generation searching for an escape from the region’s political strife. The film’s exquisite monochrome cinematography—each frame a masterpiece sculpted from light and shadow—and time-bending, elliptical editing create a ravishing sensory experience that hovers between consciousness and dreaming."

In postwar Germany, Irene Wagner (Bergman) conceals an adulterous affair from her prominent husband (Mathias Wieman).

Jacques Rozier’s final film is a joyful compendium of his major themes and strategies as well as one of the funniest depictions of the theater ever committed to celluloid. When a director (Mike Marshall) decides—out of superstition—to overhaul his play after a successful six-month run, he unwittingly instigates changes that appear to doom the production. Enter, by pure coincidence, Gaston (Jean Lefebvre), a friend of the star, Fifi (Lydia Feld as Lili Vonderfeld), and the possessor of a near-perfect memory that allows him to quickly assume one of the major roles. Everything seems to fall into place until Gaston gambles his advance to raise money for his own struggling theatrical company, loses his recall abilities, and becomes the target of revenge by the man he replaced onstage (Yves Afonso). Filled to the brim with punning wordplay, theatrical allusions, and the delicious chaos of backstage maneuvering, Fifi Martingale is perhaps Rozier’s finest comedic take on the wild digressions and nick-of-time improvisations that make up both art and life."

A hilarious saga of good intentions confounded, the story chronicles a firemen’s ball where nothing goes right, from a beauty pageant whose reluctant participants embarrass the organizers to a lottery from which nearly all the prizes are pilfered. Presumed to be a commentary on the floundering Czech leadership, the film was “banned forever” in Czechoslovakia following the Russian invasion and prompted Forman’s move to America."

Starring Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa, Mickey Curtis

An agonizing portrait of desperate Japanese soldiers stranded in a strange land during World War II, Kon Ichikawa’s FIRES ON THE PLAIN is a compelling descent into psychological and physical oblivion. Denied hospital treatment for tuberculosis and cast off into the unknown, Private Tamura treks across an unfamiliar Philippine landscape, encountering an increasingly debased cross section of Imperial Army soldiers, who eventually give in to the most terrifying craving of all. Grisly yet poetic, FIRES ON THE PLAIN is one of the most powerful works from one of Japanese cinema’s most versatile filmmakers."

Starring Maurice Ronet, Léna Skerla, Jeanne Moreau

After garnering international acclaim for such seminal crowd-pleasers as THE LOVERS and ZAZIE DANS LE MÉTRO, Louis Malle gave his fans a shock with THE FIRE WITHIN (LE FEU FOLLET), a penetrating study of individual and social inertia. Maurice Ronet (ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS), in an implosive, haunted performance, plays Alain Leroy, a self-destructive writer who resolves to kill himself and spends the next twenty-four hours trying to reconnect with a host of wayward friends. Unsparing in its portrait of Alain’s inner turmoil and shot with remarkable clarity, THE FIRE WITHIN is one of Malle’s darkest and most personal films."

One of the ineffably lovely domestic sagas made by Yasujiro Ozu at the height of his mastery, THE FLAVOR OF GREEN TEA OVER RICE is a sublimely piercing portrait of a marriage coming quietly undone. Secrets and deceptions strain the already tenuous relationship of a childless, middle-aged couple, as the wife’s city-bred sophistication bumps up against the husband’s small-town simplicity, and a generational sea change—in the form of her headstrong, modern niece—sweeps over their household. The director’s abiding concern with family dynamics receives one of its most spirited treatments, with a wry, tender humor and buoyant expansiveness that moves the action from the home into the baseball stadiums, pachinko parlors, and ramen shops of postwar Tokyo."

Set amid the bombed-out landscapes of postwar Japan, FLOATING CLOUDS stars the director’s frequent collaborator, the heartbreaking Hideko Takamine, as a woman who returns from working in French Indochina with hopes of resuming her relationship with a married man (Masayuki Mori) with whom she had an affair—leading them both into a self-destructive spiral of hurt and anger.

Setting his later version in a seaside location, Ozu otherwise preserves the details of his elegantly simple plot wherein an aging actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his former lover and illegitimate son, a scenario that enrages his current mistress and results in heartbreak for all. Together, the films offer a unique glimpse into the evolution of one of cinema’s greatest directors. A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS reveals Ozu in the midst of developing his mode of expression; FLOATING WEEDS reveals his distinct style at its pinnacle. In each, the director captures the joy and sadness in everyday life."

An intoxicating, time-bending experience bathed in the golden glow of oil lamps and wreathed in an opium haze, this gorgeous period reverie by Hou Hsiao-hsien traces the romantic intrigue, jealousies, and tensions swirling around four late-nineteenth-century Shanghai “flower houses,” where courtesans live confined to a gilded cage, ensconced in opulent splendor but forced to work to buy back their freedom. Among the regular clients is the taciturn Master Wang (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), whose relationship with his longtime mistress (Michiko Hada) is roiled by a perceived act of betrayal. Composed in a languorous procession of entrancing long takes, FLOWERS OF SHANGHAI evokes a vanished world of decadence and cruelty, an insular universe where much of the dramatic action remains tantalizingly offscreen—even as its emotional fallout registers with quiet devastation."

Unlike his 1923 film REGENERATION, Richard Norman’s THE FLYING ACE exists in its entirety, and the image quality is stunning. A rural crime drama revolving around a pair of rival aviators, THE FLYING ACE illuminates the fact that many films made for African American audiences were less concerned with race than with making popular entertainment in the traditional Hollywood style. Filmed in the Arlington area of Jacksonville, Florida, THE FLYING ACE is a unique aviation melodrama in that no airplanes actually leave the ground (the spectacular flight scenes being performed on terra firma, in front of neutral backdrops). Norman divided the film into four chapters, so that exhibitors could show the film as a feature or as a four-episode serial. The film is buoyed by the presence of Norman Studios regular Steve “Peg” Reynolds as the hero’s one-legged sidekick, who in one memorable scene rides a bicycle while firing a rifle built into the shaft of his crutch."

Before he became a sensation with the twisty revenge story MEMENTO, Christopher Nolan fashioned this low-budget, 16 mm black-and-white neonoir with comparable precision and cunning. Providing irrefutable evidence of Nolan’s directorial bravura, FOLLOWING is the fragmented tale of an unemployed young writer who trails strangers through London, hoping that they will provide inspiration for his first novel. He gets more than he bargained for when one of his unwitting subjects leads him down a dark criminal path. With gritty aesthetics and a made-on-the-fly vibe (many shots were simply stolen on the streets, unbeknownst to passersby), FOLLOWING is a mind-bending psychological journey that shows the remarkable beginnings of one of today’s most acclaimed filmmakers."

Built around explosive performances from Sam Shepard and Kim Basinger, Robert Altman’s adaptation of Shepard’s play is a simmering drama of forbidden love set amid a dreamlike vision of the American West. Cowboy drifter Eddie (Sam Shepard) reconnects with May (Kim Basinger), the love of his life, in a seedy desert motel even though she’s taken up with a new boyfriend (Randy Quaid). But that’s not the only threat to their rekindled passion. A mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) also harbors a secret so dark and shocking, it could destroy Eddie and May’s love forever."

In July 1969, the space race ended when Apollo 11 fulfilled President Kennedy’s challenge of “landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” No one who witnessed the lunar landing will ever forget it. Al Reinert’s documentary FOR ALL MANKIND is the story of the twenty-four men who traveled to the moon, told in their words, in their voices, using the images of their experiences. Forty years after the first moon landing, it remains the most radical, visually dazzling work of cinema yet made about this earthshaking event."

In 1940, Alfred Hitchcock made his official transition from the British film industry to Hollywood. And it was quite a year: his first two American movies, REBECCA and FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, were both nominated for the best picture Oscar. Though REBECCA prevailed, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT is the more quintessential Hitch film. A full-throttle espionage thriller, starring Joel McCrea as a green Yank reporter sent to Europe to get the scoop on the imminent war, it’s wall-to-wall witty repartee, head-spinning plot twists, and brilliantly mounted suspense set pieces, including an ocean plane crash climax with astonishing special effects. FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT deserves to be mentioned alongside THE 39 STEPS and NORTH BY NORTHWEST as one of the master’s greatest adventures."

Bergman let his storytelling skills roam freely in this film, drawing from his cinematic and theatrical experience (as a playwright as well as a director), cutting forward and backward in a visual and narrative tour-de-force that rivaled his best experimental work of the 1960s."

Directed with pre-Code verve by Lewis Milestone, the first screen adaptation of the oft-filmed Broadway hit by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur (later the basis for Howard Hawks’s screwball classic HIS GIRL FRIDAY) stars Adolphe Menjou and Pat O’Brien as, respectively, a newspaper editor and his ace reporter, who must pull out all the stops in order to get the scoop of a lifetime: the story of an escaped death-row inmate whose whereabouts are known only to them. The crackling dialogue, cynical wit, and snappy pace set the standard for a generation of newsroom pictures to follow.

Starring Dore Mann, Mary Wall, Carmine Marino

A nightmare transmission from the grungiest depths of the New York indie underground, the visceral, darkly funny, and totally sui generis debut feature from Ronald Bronstein is a dread-inducing vision of misfit alienation at its unhinged extreme. In a maniacal performance of almost frightening commitment, Dore Mann plays Keith, a disturbingly maladjusted social outcast and self-described “troll” whose neuroses plunge him into an unstoppable spiral of self-obliteration as his crummy coupon-selling job, pitiful living situation (featuring the roommate from hipster Brooklyn hell), and last remaining human relationships disintegrate around him. As captured in the grimy expressionist grain of Sean Price Williams’s claustrophobic camera work, FROWNLAND is DIY cinema at its most fearless, uncompromising, and unforgettable."

Starring Susanne Lothar, Ulrich Mühe, Arno Frisch

Michael Haneke’s most notorious provocation, FUNNY GAMES spares no detail in its depiction of the agony of a bourgeois family held captive at their vacation home by a pair of white-gloved young men. In a series of escalating “games,” the sadistic duo subject their victims to unspeakable physical and psychological torture over the course of a night. A home-invasion thriller in which the genre’s threat of bloodshed is made stomach-churningly real, the film ratchets up shocks even as its executioners interrupt the action to address the audience, drawing queasy attention to the way that cinema milks pleasure from pain and stokes our appetite for atrocity. With this controversial treatise on violence and entertainment, Haneke issued a summation of his cinematic philosophy, implicating his audience in a spectacle of unbearable cruelty."

Three years into a murderous regime that would be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans, Amin prepared a triumphal greeting for the filmmakers, staging rallies, military maneuvers, and cheery displays of national pride, and envisioning the film as an official portrait to adorn his cult of personality. Schroeder, however, had other ideas, emerging with a disquieting, caustically funny brief against Amin, in which the dictator’s own endless stream of testimony—by turns charming, menacing, and nonsensical—serves as the most damning evidence. A revelatory tug-of-war between subject and filmmaker, GENERAL IDI AMIN DADA: A SELF-PORTRAIT is a landmark in the art of documentary and an appalling study of egotism in power."

Capturing everything from the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the liberation of Paris to the horrors of Dachau and the bombed-out ravages of Berlin, this remarkable slice of history offers a look in vivid color at some of the most consequential moments of the twentieth century and tells the gripping story of a combat camera unit at war."

Over the course of one hot summer, a group of children in the decaying rural South must confront a tangle of difficult choices.

Starring Edmund Meschke, Ernst Pittschau, Ingetraud Hinze

The concluding chapter of Roberto Rossellini’s War Trilogy is the most devastating, a portrait of an obliterated Berlin, seen through the eyes of a twelve-year-old boy. Living in a bombed-out apartment building with his sick father and two older siblings, young Edmund is mostly left to wander unsupervised, getting ensnared in the black-market schemes of a group of teenagers and coming under the nefarious influence of a Nazi-sympathizing ex-teacher. GERMANY YEAR ZERO is a daring, gut-wrenching look at the consequences of fascism, for society and the individual."

Carl Dreyer’s last film neatly crowns his career: a meditation on tragedy, individual will and the refusal to compromise. A woman leaves her unfulfilling marriage and embarks on a search for ideal love—but neither a passionate affair with a younger man nor the return of an old romance can provide the answer she seeks. Always the stylistic innovator, Dreyer employs long takes and theatrical staging to concentrate on Nina Pens Rode’s sublime portrayal of the proud and courageous Gertrud."

Jim Jarmusch combined his love for the ice-cool crime dramas of Jean-Pierre Melville and Seijun Suzuki with the philosophical dimensions of samurai mythology for an eccentrically postmodern take on the hit-man thriller. In one of his defining roles, Forest Whitaker brings a commanding serenity to his portrayal of a Zen contract killer working for a bumbling mob outfit, a modern man who adheres steadfastly to the ideals of the Japanese warrior code even as chaos and violence spiral around him. Featuring moody cinematography by the great Robby Müller, a sublime score by the Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA, and a host of colorful character actors (including a memorably stone-faced Henry Silva), GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI plays like a pop-culture-sampling cinematic mixtape built around a one-of-a-kind tragic hero."

In Karyn Kusama’s raw, understated feature debut, Rodriguez commands the screen with both tightly coiled intensity and deep wells of vulnerability as a young woman hitting back at society’s expectations and her own personal demons. Capturing the full emotional weight of Diana’s journey and the kinetic thrill of bodies in motion, Kusama crafts a singularly uncompromising story of self-realization."

As they tour Sweden in a theatrical production of “Lysistrata,” performing to often uncomprehending audiences, three women (national cinema icons Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson, and Gunnel Lindblom) find their own lives and marriages mirrored in the complex, combative gender relations at the heart of Aristophanes’s play.

Agnès Varda’s extraordinary late-career renaissance began with this wonderfully idiosyncratic, self-reflexive documentary in which the French cinema icon explores the world of modern-day gleaners: those living on the margins who survive by foraging for what society throws away. Embracing the intimacy and freedom of digital filmmaking, Varda posits herself as a kind of gleaner of images and ideas, one whose generous, expansive vision makes room for ruminations on everything from aging to the birth of cinema to the beauty of heart-shaped potatoes. By turns playful, philosophical, and subtly political, THE GLEANERS AND I is a warmly human reflection on the contradictions of our consumerist world from an artist who, like her subjects, finds unexpected richness where few think to look."

Agnès Varda’s charming follow-up to her acclaimed documentary THE GLEANERS AND I is a deceptively unassuming grace note that takes us deeper into the world of those who find purpose and beauty in the refuse of society. Revisiting many of the original film’s subjects to explore the often unexpected effects that their participation in the project has had on their lives, this wonderfully warm and human epilogue once again takes gleaning as the starting point from which to explore what most interests Varda: the richness, complexity, and poignancy of life outside the mainstream. What emerges is a crazy-quilt tapestry of the personal, the political, and the esoteric that celebrates the spirit and creativity of those who forge their own path."

Adapted from a novel by Nobel Prize winner Peter Handke, Wim Wenders’s first theatrical feature crosses Hitchcock with Kafka for an arresting study of existential ennui, violence, and the lure of American culture in postwar Europe. After he is ejected from a game in Vienna, unsettlingly disaffected soccer goalie Joseph Bloch (Arthur Brauss) wanders aimlessly through the city, seemingly detached from everything around him—until an encounter with a cinema cashier (Erika Pluhar) takes a dark turn. Working with cinematographer Robby Müller and editor Peter Przygodda, Wenders assembled a collaborative team that would define his work for years."

Starring Elliott Crosset Hove, Vic Carmen Sonne, Ingvar Sigurdsson

The struggle between the strictures of religion and our own brute animal nature plays out amid the beautifully forbidding landscapes of remote Iceland in this stunning psychological epic from director Hlynur Pálmason. In the late nineteenth century, Danish priest Lucas (Elliott Crosset Hove) makes the perilous trek to Iceland’s southeastern coast with the intention of establishing a church. There, the arrogant man of God finds his resolve tested as he confronts the harsh terrain, temptations of the flesh, and the reality of being an intruder in an unforgiving land. What unfolds is a transfixing journey into the heart of colonial darkness attuned to both the majesty and terrifying power of the natural world.

“GODLAND tells a story of natural wonder, elemental beauty, and human folly.”
—Justin Chang, “Los Angeles Times”

“Visually striking . . .  Like some kind of Arctic, art-house THERE WILL BE BLOOD . . . [Hlynur Pálmason is] a cinematic original whose voice grows stronger and more certain with each film.”
—Peter Debruge, “Variety”

“Harshness is transformed into beauty and then terror by this extraordinary film . . . deeply mysterious and unbearably sad.”

GODZILLA (a.k.a. GOJIRA) is the roaring granddaddy of all monster movies. It’s also a remarkably humane and melancholy drama, made in Japan at a time when the country was reeling from nuclear attack and H-bomb testing in the Pacific. Its rampaging radioactive beast, the poignant embodiment of an entire population’s fears, became a beloved international icon of destruction, spawning almost thirty sequels."

Diving into delirious realms of imagination, this second film of the Godzilla franchise’s 1980s resurgence showcased the towering beast for a new generation of fans. This time, Godzilla’s foe is one of the series’ most wondrously strange kaiju creations: Biollante—a mutant plant genetically engineered from the cells of a rose, a renegade scientist’s dead daughter, and Godzilla itself.

The eighteenth film in the Godzilla franchise puts a time-traveling twist on the The King of the Monsters’ ever-evolving mythology as nefarious actors from the future go back in time to engineer the rise of the three-headed dragon King Ghidorah, erase Godzilla from history, and stop Japan’s economic ascent.

Amid the consumerist wonderland of a shopping mall, a cadre of store employees bounce in and out of one another’s arms in a cycle of breakups, makeups, misunderstandings, and reunions, their romantic roundelay punctuated by imaginatively stylized production numbers. Working with frequent star Delphine Seyrig and a remarkable team of writers—who between them penned everything from JULES AND JIM to DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN—Akerman deftly balances the shiny pop pleasures of the genre with piercing variations on her signature themes, including a startlingly moving reflection on Jewish resilience and the legacy of the Holocaust."

Starring Masahiko Shimazu, Koji Shidara, Kuniko Miyake

A lighthearted take on director Yasujiro Ozu’s perennial theme of the challenges of inter­generational relationships, GOOD MORNING tells the story of two young boys who stop speaking in protest after their parents refuse to buy a television set. Ozu weaves a wealth of subtle gags through a family portrait as rich as those of his dramatic films, mocking the foibles of the adult world through the eyes of his child protagonists. Shot in stunning color and set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new washing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door salesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I WAS BORN, BUT . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan."

GOOD TIMES, WONDERFUL TIMES is director Lionel Rogosin’s urgent plea for humanity and his searing condemnation of war and fascism. For two years, Rogosin traveled to twelve countries to collect footage of war atrocities from their archives. To lend the film a caustic bite, he interspersed these harrowing images with scenes of a London cocktail party’s mundane chatter—daring viewers to continue to treat such horrors as abstract. Released in 1964 at the height of the Vietnam War, this powerful call for peace stands as one of the great antiwar films of the era."

A biblical epic that only the Marxist dissident Pier Paolo Pasolini could make, this intensely faithful adaptation of Saint Matthew’s Gospel depicts the life and teachings of Jesus Christ (Enrique Irazoqui, a Spanish economics student and Communist activist), whose unwavering compassion for the poor and defiant condemnation of moral hypocrisy make him a perhaps unexpected embodiment of the director’s own worldview. Stunningly shot amid the timeless landscapes of southern Italy and set to a soundtrack that encompasses everything from Bach to Black spirituals, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW cuts past dogma and straight to the core of Jesus’s radical humanism."

Something of a companion to Pialat’s first feature, L’ENFANCE NUE, GRADUATE FIRST once again finds the director training his unflinching gaze on the dead-end youth of France with a heightened vérité immediacy that’s realer than realism."

With its deeply unsettling, progressively chilling atmosphere, THE GRAPES OF DEATH may be director Jean Rollin’s most traditionally frightening film, unfolding like an ever-expanding nightmare whose noose is drawn all the tighter by the efforts of its young heroine to escape it."

In 1924, neophyte filmmakers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack—later to achieve cinematic immortality as the makers of KING KONG—joined forces with journalist and spy Marguerite Harrison and set off to film an adventure. They found excitement, danger, and drama in the migration of the Bakhtiari nomads of Persia (now Iran). Twice a year, more than fifty thousand people and half a million animals surmounted seemingly impossible obstacles—braving the icy, raging waters of the half-mile-wide Karun River and winding their way up the side of the sheer, snow-covered rock face of the fifteen-thousand-foot-high Zardeh Kuh mountain—to take their herds to pasture. Risking their own lives in the process, Cooper and Schoedsack captured astonishing, unforgettable images of courage and determination and created one of the cinema’s first great documentaries."

Chaplin, in his first pure talkie, brings his sublime physicality to two roles: the cruel yet clownish “Tomainian” dictator and the kindly Jewish barber who is mistaken for him. Featuring Jack Oakie and Paulette Goddard in stellar supporting turns, THE GREAT DICTATOR, boldly going after the fascist leader before the U.S.’s official entry into World War II, is an audacious amalgam of politics and slapstick that culminates in Chaplin’s famously impassioned speech."

The plot is a piercing look at postwar Britain, and efforts to move the nation into the modern age -- that doesn&#39;t sit well with the people of Anderia Marsh, who have claimed a right (going back to Henry III) to evade government-imposed import duties and taxes. And when the government decides to curb this right, the whole village quietly rises up in a comical rebellion."

Starring Marie Rivière, María Luisa García, Vincent Gauthier

Eric Rohmer captures the ache of summertime sadness with exquisite poignancy in this luminous tale of self-exploration. The Jules Verne novel of the same name provides the loose inspiration for the story of Delphine (Marie Rivière), a dreamy, introverted young secretary who, reeling from a breakup with her boyfriend, faces the anxiety-inducing prospect of spending her summer vacation alone. As she bounces from a getaway in Cherbourg to the tourist-choked Alps to the sunny beaches of Biarritz, Delphine passes through a whirl of social activity—but through it all remains profoundly alone, searching for the true human connection that seems to perpetually elude her. As honest a portrait of loneliness, depression, and the longing for understanding as has ever been committed to film, THE GREEN RAY stands as one of the most piercingly perceptive works by the French cinema’s keenest observer of human relationships."

An unflinching reckoning with the horrors of the Holocaust, this intense moral drama from Tim Blake Nelson (adapting his own play) considers the cost of survival in the most extreme of circumstances. At the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp, a group of Jewish prisoners known as the Sonderkommando are tasked with the horrifying job of helping to exterminate fellow Jews under threat of death. When a fourteen-year-old girl somehow survives the gas chamber, the Sonderkommando become determined to save her—even if it means risking their own lives."

Years before his international breakthrough L’AVVENTURA, Michelangelo Antonioni made his first masterpiece with IL GRIDO, a raw expression of anguish that remains one of Italian cinema’s great overlooked gems. Bridging the director’s early, neorealism-inspired work and his hallmark stories of existential rootlessness, Il grido centers on Aldo (Steve Cochran), a sugar-refinery worker in the Po valley, whose hopes of marrying his longtime lover (Alida Valli) are dashed when she declares she’s fallen in love with another man. Shocked and demoralized, Aldo leaves town with his daughter, drifting through the Po’s small villages as his prospects dwindle and his connections with other women—including an an old girlfriend (Betsy Blair), a gas-station owner (Dorian Gray), and a sex worker (Lyn Shaw)—fizzle out into alienation and despair. Boldly using environment to convey character, IL GRIDO reveals a director in the process of discovering his artistic signature and applying it to this most personal of statements about the human condition."

“Guelwaar” is the nickname of Pierre Henri Thioune (Thierno Ndiaye), a political radical and agitator whose criticism of Senegal’s reliance on foreign aid ruffles the feathers of the powers-that-be. His suspicious death is followed by a farcical mix-up when his corpse is mistaken for that of another man and accidentally interred in an Islamic cemetery. Guelwaar’s family, led by Europeanized son Barthelemy (Ndiawar Diop), enlists the local police to unearth and then rebury their paterfamilias on Catholic ground, but Muslim resistance sparks a religious conflict and unleashes long held hostilities among townspeople and within the Thioune clan. At once a tragicomic study of social atomization and a hopeful vision of Pan-African solidarity and independence, GUELWAAR is Ousmane Sembène’s master class in interweaving complex storylines and merging disparate stylistic tones."

When his ex-wife (Faye Emerson) reappears with the news that their son has been kidnapped, Thursday must find a way to stay off the sauce long enough to track him down.

Training his coolly detached, perpetually static camera on a cross section of hooligans, bikers, buskers, and oddballs, Östlund fashions a wild, weird, and at times surprisingly sensitive look at the ineffable strangeness of human nature."

Guiding everything is his belief in a world in which we are all connected by “one red blood.”"

Mathieu Kassovitz took the film world by storm with LA HAINE, a gritty, unsettling, and visually explosive look at the racial and cultural volatility in modern-day France, specifically the low-income banlieue districts on Paris’s outskirts. Aimlessly passing their days in the concrete environs of their dead-end suburbia, Vinz (Vincent Cassel), Hubert (Hubert Koundé), and Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui), a Jew, an African, and an Arab, give human faces to France’s immigrant populations, their bristling resentment at their marginalization slowly simmering until it reaches a climactic boiling point. A work of tough beauty, LA HAINE is a landmark of contemporary French cinema and a gripping reflection of its country’s ongoing identity crisis."

He plays a bumbling wannabe kung-fu master who, when he assumes the identity of a dead hero, finds himself embroiled in a series of absurd misadventures and the search for a pair of mystical artifacts. Cartoon sound effects and send-ups of everything from Popeye to JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR are part of the lighthearted fun—not to mention Chan fighting a bald adversary with his own wig!"

The bones are half of the remains of her dead Japanese grandmother, which she is supposed to deliver to her estranged mother. A narrative and visual web of family stories, home movies, and documentary footage, HALVING THE BONES provides a spirited exploration of the meaning of family, history, memory, cultural identity, and what it means to have been named after Babe Ruth!"

Im brings a true auteur&#39;s sensibility to his documentary. He heightens certain sounds, such as the crash of swimmers entering the water or the thump of a diving platform.

Like IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, THE HAND is set in the hazy Hong Kong of the 1960s, but its characters couldn’t be more different from the earlier film’s restrained, haunted lovers. Originally conceived for the omnibus film EROS, the film—presented in this retrospective for the first time in its extended cut—tells the tale of Zhang (Chang Chen), a shy tailor’s assistant enraptured by a mysterious client, Miss Hua (Gong Li). A hypnotic tale of obsession, repression, and class divisions, THE HAND finds Wong Kar Wai continuing to transition from the frenetic, energized style of his earlier films into a register that is lush with romantic grandeur."

Scripted with Chekhovian brilliance and performed by a virtuoso ensemble cast that includes an Oscar-winning Wiest and Caine, HANNAH AND HER SISTERS finds Allen achieving the perfect balance between the Bergmanesque European art cinema he idolized and his own distinctive, New York–neurotic comic voice."

One of the most searing romances of the 1990s, Wong Kar Wai’s emotionally raw, lushly stylized portrait of a relationship in breakdown casts Hong Kong superstars Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Leslie Cheung Kwok Wing as a couple traveling through Argentina and locked in a turbulent cycle of infatuation and destructive jealousy as they break up, make up, and fall apart again and again. Setting out to depict the dynamics of a queer relationship with empathy and complexity on the cusp of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong—when the country’s LGBTQ community suddenly faced an uncertain future—Wong crafts a feverish look at the life cycle of a love affair that is by turns devastating and deliriously romantic. Shot by ace cinematographer Christopher Doyle in both luminous monochrome and luscious saturated color, HAPPY TOGETHER is an intoxicating exploration of displacement and desire that swoons with the ache and exhilaration of love at its heart-tearing extremes."

A HARD DAY’S NIGHT, in which the bandmates play cheeky comic versions of themselves, captured the astonishing moment when they officially became the singular, irreverent idols of their generation and changed music forever. Directed with raucous, anything-goes verve by Richard Lester and featuring a slew of iconic pop anthems, including the title track, “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “I Should Have Known Better,” and “If I Fell,” A HARD DAY’S NIGHT, which reconceived the movie musical and exerted an incalculable influence on the music video, is one of the most deliriously entertaining movies of all time."

Far from a dry dissertation on the topic, the film itself is a witches’ brew of the scary, the gross, and the darkly humorous.

HELL-BOUND TRAIN is arguably the most significant rediscovery in Pioneers of African American Cinema. The film is the work of self-taught filmmakers James and Eloyce Gist, African American evangelists who employed cinema as a tool for their traveling ministry. Their surreal visual allegories were screened in churches and meeting halls, accompanied by a sermon and the passing of a collection plate. Rather than having a linear story, the film is instead a catalog of iniquity, a car-by-car dramatization of the sins of the Jazz Age (including gambling, dancing, alcohol, and the mistreatment of animals), presided over by a horned devil and culminating in a colossal derailment (a model train tossed into a bonfire). Admittedly, the production values are minimal—shot with handheld 16 mm equipment using natural light, sans audio—but the surreality of it all makes for a compelling viewing experience, and shows that renegade, visionary filmmakers can be found in the most unexpected places. HELL-BOUND TRAIN is presented here with a score by Dr. Samuel Waymon, best known to cineastes as having provided the moody soundtrack for Bill Gunn’s influential 1973 film GANJA AND HESS. It is believed that HELL-BOUND TRAIN was filmed prior to James’s marriage to Eloyce, so it is unclear how much involvement she had in the making of the film. But she may have had a hand in the editing and was certainly engaged in all aspects of their subsequent work."

Stanley Baker stars as the ex-convict Tom Yately, who takes on a high-pressure job as a truck driver doing dangerously fast runs for a company riddled with corruption. When he attempts to expose his boss’s unethical business practices, Yately finds that he has put his life in jeopardy.

On the heels of his similarly ethereal GHOST TROPIC, rising director Bas Devos offers another mood-drenched Brussels city symphony. With a quiet grace that’s becoming a trademark, he captures both the longing of contemporary urban life and the potential for enchantment that still exists in spaces shared by strangers from different worlds."

When Mukherjee boards an overnight train to Delhi to accept an award, a journalist (Sharmila Tagore) approaches him seeking an exclusive interview, which initiates a conversation that sends the actor reeling down a path of self-examination. Seamlessly integrating rueful flashbacks and surreal dream sequences with the quietly revelatory stories of the train’s other passengers, THE HERO is a graceful meditation on art, fame, and regret from one of world cinema’s most keenly perceptive filmmakers."

Her bittersweet tale is skillfully interwoven with clips from a wide array of scientific and educational films, as well as interviews with adult lesbians who recount their adolescent attractions to girls, how they felt when they first heard the word “lesbian,” where they fit in the butch/femme continuum, and their thoughts about how they became baby dykes. HIDE AND SEEK is for every woman who’s been to a slumber party and every man who wonders what went on at one."

The French television series “Les enthousiastes” asked art aficionados to offer their thoughts on, and interpretations of, paintings that they themselves selected. For Jean Eustache’s episode, Jean-Noël Picq (of A DIRTY STORY) chose the third panel of Hieronymus Bosch’s triptych “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” an apocalyptic nightmare-scape that anticipated the darkest reaches of surrealism by almost four hundred years. Looking beyond its obvious grotesqueries, Picq points out several notable qualities of Bosch’s masterwork, including its near absence of perspective, its conflation of ontological categories (human and animal, living and dead, time and space), and its objective depiction of sadomasochistic pleasure."

True to its title, this slice-of-life satire is one of director Mike Leigh’s warmest and most optimistic films—though it’s still laced with more than a touch of bittersweet melancholy. Focusing on counterculture couple Cyril (Phil Davis) and Shirley (Ruth Sheen)—a pair of generous, pot-smoking Marxists wrestling with the decision of whether or not to have a baby—and their materialistic, middle-class extended family, HIGH HOPES offers an at once affectionate and slyly critical portrait of generational, social, and class divides within Thatcher-era Britain."

One of the fastest, funniest, and most quotable films ever made, HIS GIRL FRIDAY stars Rosalind Russell as reporter Hildy Johnson, a standout among cinema’s powerful women. Hildy is matched in force only by her conniving but charismatic editor and ex-husband, Walter Burns (played by the peerless Cary Grant), who dangles the chance for her to scoop her fellow news writers with the story of an impending execution in order to keep her from hopping the train that’s supposed to take her to Albany and a new life as a housewife. When adapting Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s smash hit play “The Front Page,” director Howard Hawks had the inspired idea of turning star reporter Hildy Johnson into a woman, and the result is an immortal mix of hard-boiled newsroom setting with ebullient remarriage comedy."

On the run through Europe from her wealthy, cruelly possessive husband, an unhappy socialite (Jean Arthur) is thrown together by fate with a suave stranger (Charles Boyer)—and soon the two are bound in a consuming, seemingly impossible affair that stretches across continents and brings them to the very edge of catastrophe. Lent a palpable erotic charge by the chemistry between its leads, this delirious vision of lovers beset by the world passes through a dizzying array of tonal shifts—from melodrama to romantic comedy to noir to disaster thriller—smoothly guided by Borzage’s unwavering allegiance to the power of love."

This stylish early gem from Stephen Frears boasts terrific performances from a roster of England’s best hard-boiled actors, music by Eric Clapton and virtuoso flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía, and ravishing photography of its desolate Spanish locations—a splendid backdrop for a rather sordid story."

In Ronald Neame’s film of Joyce Cary’s classic novel, Alec Guinness transforms himself into one of cinema’s most indelible comic figures: the lovably scruffy painter Gulley Jimson. As the ill-behaved Jimson searches for a perfect canvas, he determines to let nothing come between himself and the realization of his exalted vision. A perceptive examination of the struggle of artistic creation, THE HORSE’S MOUTH is also Neame’s comic masterpiece."

Filmed over the course of fifteen hours, from evening to dawn, with cinematographer and frequent collaborator Babette Mangolte’s carefully controlled camera gradually making its way from the lamplit lobby to the rooftop overlooking an awakening city, this radical, silent experiment in duration stands as one of Akerman’s most arresting formal achievements, collapsing time and charging the quotidian space it surveys with an eerie unreality."

A complex portrait of a city and its inhabitants, this urgent documentary from Brett Story (THE PRISON IN TWELVE LANDSCAPES) gives us a window into the collective consciousness of the present. The film’s point of departure is New York City, including its outer boroughs, during the month of August 2017. It’s a time heavy with the tension of a new president, growing anxiety over everything from rising rents to marching white nationalists, and unrelenting news of either wildfires or hurricanes on every coast. The film pivots on the question of futurity: what does the future look like from where we are standing? And what if we are not all standing in the same place? THE HOTTEST AUGUST offers a portrait of a society on the verge of catastrophe, registering the anxieties, distractions, and survival strategies that preoccupy ordinary lives."

How to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi’s indescribable 1977 movie HOUSE (HAUSU)? As a psychedelic ghost tale? A stream-of-consciousness bedtime story? An episode of “Scooby-Doo” as directed by Mario Bava? Any of the above will do for this hallucinatory head trip about a schoolgirl who travels with six classmates to her ailing aunt’s creaky country home and comes face-to-face with evil spirits, a demonic house cat, a bloodthirsty piano, and other ghoulish visions, all realized by Obayashi via mattes, animation, and collage effects.

Based on the novel by Francine Prose, Nancy Savoca’s wonderfully warm chronicle of a spirited Italian American New York family gracefully balances humor, tragedy, and pathos. Vincent D’Onofrio’s Joseph Santangelo is a butcher with a wicked sense of humor who “wins” his wife Catherine (Tracey Ullman) in a pinochle game. Over the protests of his mother (Judith Malina) who talks to ghosts and makes deals with saints, Joseph marries Catherine. When the old lady dies, her spirit is channeled into her granddaughter Teresa, who overtakes the film with her yearning to serve God. A luminous Lili Taylor imbues Teresa with a mix of idiosyncratic charm and touching innocence."

The only film directed by trailblazing feminist Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad finds unexpected grace where few would think to look: a leper colony whose inhabitants live, worship, learn, play, and celebrate in a self-contained community cut off from the rest of the world. Through ruminative voiceover narration drawn from the Old Testament, the Koran, and the filmmaker’s own poetry and unflinching images that refuse to look away from physical difference, Farrokhzad creates a profoundly empathetic portrait of those cast off by society—a face-to-face encounter with the humanity behind the disease. A key forerunner of the Iranian New Wave, THE HOUSE IS BLACK is a triumph of transcendent lyricism from a visionary artist whose influence is only beginning to be fully appreciated."

A torrent of sexual obsession, revenge, and betrayal is unleashed under one roof in this venomous melodrama from South Korean master Kim Ki-young. Immensely popular in its home country when it was released, THE HOUSEMAID is the thrilling, at times jaw-dropping story of the devastating effect an unstable housemaid has on the domestic cocoon of a bourgeois, morally dubious music teacher, his devoted wife, and their precocious young children. Grim and taut yet perched on the border of the absurd, Kim’s film is an engrossing tale of class warfare and familial disintegration that has been hugely influential on the new generation of South Korean filmmakers.

Writer-director Bruce Robinson and star Richard E.

Grant gives a virtuosically crazed performance as an ambitious advertising exec whose latest assignment—devising a campaign for a pimple cream—has him on the edge of a nervous breakdown. When he sprouts an enormous boil on his shoulder—one that not only talks but has evil ambitions of its own—a twisted battle of wills ensues. With fantastically fleshy body-horror effects and flourishes of gonzo surrealism, this tour de force of verbal jousting and physical comedy is a caustic Jekyll-and-Hyde tale for the greed-is-good 1980s."

In Laredo, Texas, best friends Silvia and Beba know that the long summer nights of their youth cannot last forever.

In Northern Ireland’s Maze prison in 1981, twenty-seven-year-old Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands went on a hunger strike to protest the British government’s refusal to recognize him and his fellow IRA inmates as political prisoners. McQueen dramatizes prison existence and Sands’s final days in a way that is purely experiential, even abstract, a succession of images full of both beauty and horror. Featuring an intense performance by Michael Fassbender, HUNGER is an unflinching, transcendent depiction of what a human being is willing to endure to be heard."

Starring Steve Schirripa, Sharon Angela, Emory Cohen

The directorial debut from “Sopranos” star Michael Imperioli is an intense, emotionally raw portrait of lost souls attempting to fill the spiritual voids at the center of their lives. Over the course of a kinetic thirty-six hours in New York City, a group of desperate, damaged individuals—including a late-night radio DJ on the verge of a breakdown (Steve Schirripa), his severely alienated teenage son (Emory Cohen), and a young woman (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) dealing with the aftermath of a turbulent relationship—chase meaning through drugs, sex, and moments of fleeting human connection. Capturing live-wire performances from his virtuoso ensemble cast, Imperioli gradually brings the story’s disparate strands together into a searing vision of life on the existential edge."

Carlos Saura’s international breakthrough is a tour de force of psychological tension in which three men, all veterans of the Spanish Civil War, reunite in the village of Castille for a day of drinking and rabbit hunting. There, under the sun’s hot glare, the rifts between the men begin to make themselves known, and barely repressed resentments are exposed, culminating in a shocking explosion of violence. Winner of the Silver Bear for Best Director at the Berlin International Film Festival and cited by Sam Peckinpah as a major influence, THE HUNT is a searing exorcism of Spain’s political demons."

Both a landmark of radical political cinema and one of the most visually ravishing films ever made, this legendary hymn to revolution shimmers across the screen like a fever dream of rebellion. The result of an extraordinarily ambitious collaboration between the Soviet and Cuban film industries, director Mikhail Kalatozov’s I AM CUBA unfolds in four explosive vignettes that capture Cuban life on the brink of transformation, as crushing economic exploitation and inequality give way to a working-class uprising. Backed by Carlos Fariñas’s stirring score, the dazzling camera work by Sergei Urusevsky—an inspiration for generations of filmmakers to follow—gives flight to the movie’s message of liberation."

This landmark document of Swedish society during the sexual revolution has been declared both obscene and revolutionary. It tells the story of Lena (Lena Nyman), a searching and rebellious young woman, and her personal quest to understand the social and political conditions in 1960s Sweden, as well as her bold exploration of her own sexual identity.

Over a series of intimate episodes, just about every one featuring a different man, a new hairstyle, and an outfit to match, the unsung Italian master Antonio Pietrangeli, working from a script he cowrote with Ettore Scola, composes a deft, seriocomic character study that never strays from its complicated central figure.

The emotionally charged IN A LONELY PLACE, freely adapted from a Dorothy B.

An uncompromising tale of two people desperate to love yet struggling with their demons and each other, this is one of the greatest films of the 1950s, and a benchmark in the career of the classic Hollywood auteur Nicholas Ray."

Director Lindsay Anderson brings his acclaimed stage version of David Storey’s ferocious and poignant drama to the screen, utilizing the same brilliant cast for a riveting cinematic triumph. A caustic portrait of generational hypocrisy, IN CELEBRATION unfolds in a tiny cottage in a Yorkshire mining town where hardworking, God-fearing couple Mr. and Mrs. Shaw (Bill Owen and Constance Chapman) welcome their sons—Andrew (Alan Bates), Colin (James Bolam), and Steven (Brian Cox)—home to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary. But with each son’s arrival, more and more of the Shaw’s model blue-collar family facade begins to chip away—revealing a modern family living at a medieval level of disharmony."

Two of Hong Kong cinema’s most iconic leading men, Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Andy Lau Tak-wah, face off in the breathtaking thriller that revitalized the city-state’s twenty-first-century film industry, launched a blockbuster franchise, and inspired Martin Scorsese’s THE DEPARTED. The setup is diabolical in its simplicity: two undercover moles—a police officer (Leung) assigned to infiltrate a ruthless triad by posing as a gangster, and a gangster (Lau) who becomes a police officer in order to serve as a spy for the underworld—find themselves locked in a deadly game of cat and mouse, each racing against time to unmask the other.

The first of two sequels to follow in the wake of the massively successful INFERNAL AFFAIRS softens the original’s furious pulp punch in favor of something more sweeping, elegiac, and overtly political. Flashing back in time, INFERNAL AFFAIRS II traces the tangled histories that bind the trilogy’s two pairs of adversaries: the young, dueling moles (here played by Edison Chen Koon-hei and Shawn Yue Man-lok), and the ascendant crime boss (Eric Tsang Chi-wai) and police inspector (Anthony Wong Chau-sang) whose respective rises reveal a shocking hidden connection.

Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Andy Lau Tak-wah return for the cathartic conclusion of the INFERNAL AFFAIRS trilogy, which layers on even more deep-cover intrigue while steering the series into increasingly complex psychological territory. Dancing back and forth in time to before and after the events of the original film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS III follows triad gangster turned corrupt cop Lau Kin-ming (Lau) as he goes to dangerous lengths to avoid detection, matches wits with a devious rival in the force (Leon Lai), and finds himself haunted by the fate of his former undercover nemesis (Leung). A swirl of flashbacks, memories, and hallucinations culminates in a dreamlike merging of identities that drives home the trilogy’s vision of a world in which traditional distinctions between good and evil have all but collapsed."

Starring Louis Garrel, Roschdy Zem, Noémie Merlant

Part crime thriller, part family farce, Louis Garrel’s THE INNOCENT shows the dangerous lengths two men go to, and the outlandish lies they tell, for the women they love. Garrel stars as Abel, a museum educator and widower whose mother, Sylvie (Anouk Grinberg), marries Michel (Roschdy Zem), one of her drama pupils in the local penitentiary. Once on parole, Michel attempts to start a legitimate life for Sylvie’s sake but soon reverts to his old ways, with the suspicious Abel continually—and ineptly—spying on his stepfather until roped into one of the ex-con’s schemes. Complicating matters is Clémence (Noémie Merlant), the brazen coworker who convinces Abel to break out of his emotional and romantic shell by taking part in Michel’s planned heist. Directing from his own screenplay (as cowritten by Tanguy Viel and Naïla Guiguet), Garrel explores the comedic results of playacting’s intrusion into real life, as well as real life’s comedic tendency to transform us into what we never thought we could be, but perhaps always were.

Selznick, who offered the young actor a Hollywood contract and the chance to remake INTERMEZZO in English with Leslie Howard."

Starring Sergio Rubini, Antonella Ponziani, Maurizio Mein

Something of a late-career companion to 8½, Federico Fellini’s penultimate film is a similarly self-reflexive (and self-deprecating) journey through both the director’s dream life and his cinematic world—which are, here as always in Fellini’s work, inextricably entwined. In Rome to make a documentary about the great filmmaker, a Japanese camera crew follows Fellini on a tour through his longtime home studio of Cinecittà as the maestro’s memories and fantasies unfurl in a dizzying, dazzling, time-bending love letter to the art and spectacle of moviemaking. The film’s sprawling vision even makes room for an appearance by Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg who, in an unforgettable bit of movie magic, relive their iconic Trevi Fountain scene from LA DOLCE VITA, lent new poignancy by the tacit acknowledgement of time’s passing."

Directed by Wong Kar Wai • 2000 • Hong Kong
Starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Maggie Cheung Man-yuk

Hong Kong, 1962: Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) move into neighboring apartments on the same day. Their encounters are formal and polite—until a discovery about their spouses creates an intimate bond between them. At once delicately mannered and visually extravagant, Wong Kar Wai’s IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is a masterful evocation of romantic longing and fleeting moments. With its aching musical soundtrack and exquisitely abstract cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Mark Lee Ping-bin, this film has been a major stylistic influence on the past decade of cinema, and is a milestone in Wong’s redoubtable career."

Imagine a novel so overwhelmingly hypnotic, so tremendously horrifying that it paralyzes its audience with fear and turns its most sensible readers insane. When Sutter Cane, the author of this disturbing bestseller, disappears, an insurance investigator (Sam Neill) hired to find him discovers far more than he could ever imagine in an eerie town that seems to be ripped straight from the pages of one of Cane’s books. The final installment of John Carpenter’s Apocalypse Trilogy (preceded by THE THING and PRINCE OF DARKNESS) is a spellbinding slip through the cracks between reality and the terrifying unknown."

IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES (AI NO CORRIDA), by the always provocative Japanese director Nagisa Oshima, remains one of the most controversial films of all time. Based on a true incident, it graphically depicts the all-consuming, transcendent—but ultimately destructive—love of a man and a woman (Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda) living in an era of ever escalating imperialism and governmental control.

In a small town in 1950s England, sailor Harold Guppy (Rupert Graves) takes a room in the boardinghouse run by the prim-and-proper Mrs. Beasley (Julie Walters).

For the extraordinarily beautiful second film in his Fontainhas trilogy, Pedro Costa jettisoned his earlier films&#39; larger crews to burrow even deeper into the Lisbon ghetto and the lives of its desperate inhabitants. With the intimate feel of a documentary and the texture of a Vermeer painting, IN VANDA&#39;S ROOM takes an unflinching, fragmentary look at a handful of self-destructive, marginalized people, but is centered around the heroin-addicted Vanda Duarte. Costa presents the daily routines of Vanda and her neighbors with disarming matter-of-factness, and through his camera, individuals whom many would deem disposable become vivid and vital. This was Costa&#39;s first use of digital video, and the evocative images he created remain some of the medium&#39;s most astonishing."

In Southern India, many family disputes are settled by Jamaats—all-male bodies that apply Islamic Sharia law to cases without allowing women to be present, even to defend themselves. Recognizing this fundamental inequity, a group of women in 2004 established a women’s Jamaat, which soon became a network of 12,000 members spread over twelve districts. Despite enormous resistance, they have been able to settle more than 8,000 cases to date, ranging from divorce to domestic abuse to brutal murders and more. Award-winning filmmaker Deepa Dhanraj (SOMETHING LIKE A WAR) follows several such cases, shining a light on how the women’s Jamaat has acquired power through both communal education and the leaders’ persistent, tenacious, and compassionate investigation of the crimes."

Coward and Lean ended up codirecting the large-scale project—an impressive undertaking, especially considering that neither of them had directed for the big screen before (this would be Coward’s only such credit). Cutting between a major naval battle and flashbacks to the men’s lives before they left home, IN WHICH WE SERVE (an Oscar nominee for best picture) was a major breakthrough for both filmmakers and a sensitive and stirring piece of propaganda."

Olivier Assayas’s live-wire international breakthrough stars a magnetic Maggie Cheung as a version of herself: a Hong Kong action movie star who arrives in Paris to play the latex-clad lead in a remake of Louis Feuillade’s classic 1915 crime serial LES VAMPIRES. What she finds is a behind-the-scenes tangle of barely controlled chaos as egos clash, romantic attractions simmer, and an obsessive director (a cannily cast Jean-Pierre Léaud) drives himself to the brink to realize his vision. Blending blasts of silent cinema, martial arts flicks, and the music of Sonic Youth and Ali Farka Touré into a hallucinatory swirl of postmodern cool, Assayas composes a witty reflection on the nineties French film industry and the eternal tension between art and commercial entertainment."

The first film to accomplish the very rare feat of sweeping all five major Oscar categories (best picture, best actor, best actress, best director, and best screenplay), IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is among the most gracefully constructed and edited films of the early sound era, packed with clever situations and gags that have entered the Hollywood comedy pantheon and featuring two actors at the top of their game, sparking with a chemistry that has never been bettered."

Starring Dick Powell, Linda Darnell, Jack Oakie

One of a handful of films French director René Clair made in Hollywood, this delightful period comedy displays the elegant mix of fantasy and whimsy that so often graced his work. When he miraculously begins receiving copies of the next day’s newspaper in advance, it at first seems like the break of a lifetime for turn-of-the-century reporter Lawrence Stevens (Dick Powell). But knowing the future comes with its fair share of complications, as Stevens finds out when a headline foretells his own death!"

French-cinema firebrand Leos Carax has spent forty years making galvanizing movies that float in the beautifully perplexing nether space between reality and artifice, from BOY MEETS GIRL and THE LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE to HOLY MOTORS and the recent musical ANNETTE. In his new film, he lovingly evokes the aesthetics of Jean-Luc Godard, paying aptly cheeky respect to the late New Wave master, his own career, and cinema itself, rummaging through a century of movies to situate his work within a continuum of the medium. Rather than self-aggrandize, he uses this diaristic format for an iconoclastic and impudent inquiry into power, politics, and image-making that is at once wry and playful, oblique and deeply personal.

Five young men linger in a postadolescent limbo, dreaming of adventure and escape from their small seacoast town. They while away their time spending the lira doled out by their indulgent families on drink, women, and nights at the local pool hall. Federico Fellini’s second solo directorial effort (originally released in the U.S. as THE YOUNG AND THE PASSIONATE) is a semiautobiographical masterpiece of sharply drawn character sketches: skirt chaser Fausto, forced to marry a girl he has impregnated; Alberto, the perpetual child; Leopoldo, a writer thirsting for fame; and Moraldo, the only member of the group troubled by a moral conscience. An international success and recipient of an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay, I VITELLONI compassionately details a year in the life of a group of small-town layabouts struggling to find meaning in their lives."

Marker’s LA JETÉE is one of the most influential, radical science-fiction films ever made, a tale of time travel told in still images."

Starring Chantal Akerman, Niels Arestrup, Claire Wauthion

Chantal Akerman’s first narrative feature is a startlingly vulnerable exploration of alienation and the search for connection. In a performance at once daringly exposed and enigmatic, Akerman plays a young woman who, following a lengthy, self-imposed exile, ventures out into the world, where she has two very different experiences of intimacy: first with a truck driver (Niels Arestrup) who picks her up, and then with a female ex-lover (Claire Wauthion). Culminating in an audacious, real-time carnal encounter that brought lesbian sexuality to the screen with a new frankness, JE TU IL ELLE (“I You He She”) finds Akerman wielding her radical minimalism with a newfound emotional and psychological precision."

Starring Shigeru Amachi, Utako Mitsuya, Yoichi Numata

Shocking, outrageous, and poetic, JIGOKU (HELL, a.k.a. THE SINNERS OF HELL) is the most innovative creation from Nobuo Nakagawa, the father of the Japanese horror film. After a young theology student flees a hit-and-run accident, he is plagued by both his own guilt-ridden conscience and a mysterious, diabolical doppelgänger. But all possible escape routes lead straight to hell, literally. In the gloriously gory final third of the film, Nakagawa offers up his vision of the underworld in a tour de force of torture and degradation. A striking departure from traditional Japanese ghost stories, JIGOKU, with its truly eye-popping (and -gouging) imagery, created aftershocks that are still reverberating in contemporary world horror cinema."

Having grown up in rural Vermont, far removed from the homeland of her mother, Mitra, and grandmother, Behjat, Sierra Urich knew of Iran only through family stories, food, and holidays. Seeking to make sense of her heritage, she turns to Mitra and Behjat to construct a probing and sometimes disarmingly funny history of three generations of women and their complex relationship to an Iran of the past. Interrogating family history and memory, including her grandmother’s experiences as a preteen bride and her mother’s rebellious teenage years during the Iranian Revolution, Urich crafts a rich, personal family portrait that poignantly reflects the diasporic experience."

The first Pakistani film to debut at Cannes—where it was awarded both the Jury Prize in the Un Certain Regard category and the Queer Palm—this tender, emotionally captivating debut from writer-director Saim Sadiq explores the many sides of love and desire in a patriarchal society. Gentle and timid, Haider (Ali Junejo) lives with his wife and family in Lahore. Following a long spell of unemployment, Haider finally lands a job at a Bollywood-style burlesque as a backup dancer. The unusual position shakes up the tradition-bound dynamics of his household and enables Haider to break out of his shell.

Deftly integrating real animals into its fanciful narrative, Jungle Book is a shimmering Technicolor feast, and was nominated for four Oscars, including best cinematography, art direction, special effects, and music."

The filming of the Vertigo sequences in Sans Soleil brought director Chris Marker to the Bay Area on a number of occasions in the early eighties. During those visits, Marker&#39;s friend Tom Luddy often drove him from Berkeley to Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s Zoetrope film offices in San Francisco. That journey passed by the Emeryville Mudflats, an ever-changing art gallery of driftwood sculptures and structures that intrigued Marker. Created by anonymous artists, the works would regularly wash away with the tides, only to be replaced by new ones. One day, with the help of some of the Zoetrope crew, Marker went out to immortalize the scene, which no longer exists."

The only film by the visionary dancer and choreographer Uday Shankar is a utopian dream of cultural renewal and a celebration of Indian dance in all its variety. Unfolding as an epic film within a film, KALPANA tells the story of a dancer (the director himself) who is determined to open a cultural center and breathe new life into India’s traditional artistic forms. Meanwhile, the visible adoration between him and his lead dancer arouses the jealousy of his enterprising companion. A riot of ecstatic imagery—including swirling surrealist dance spectacles—is interwoven with anticolonial, anticapitalist commentary, making for a radical, proto-Bollywood work that is one of the most influential films in Indian cinema."

Director G. W. Pabst brings a claustrophobic realism to this ticking-clock scenario, using realistic sets and sound design to create the maze of soot-choked shafts where the miners struggle for survival.

Lodge Kerrigan’s stunningly immersive portrait of a father in crisis is one of the most searing and unforgettable independent films of the early 2000s. William Keane (Damian Lewis in a tour-de-force performance) is barely able to cope. It has been six months since his six-year-old daughter was abducted from New York City’s Port Authority Bus Terminal. Repeatedly drawn to the site of the abduction, Keane wanders the bus station, compulsively replaying the events of that fateful day, as if hoping to change the outcome. One day he meets a financially strapped woman, Lynn (Amy Ryan), and her seven-year-old daughter, Kira (Abigail Breslin), at a transient hotel. As Keane becomes increasingly attached to Kira in an attempt to fill the void left by his daughter’s disappearance, Kerrigan guides this harrowing psychological study toward a climax of overwhelming emotional power."

The only film among Kenji Misumi’s seventy-plus titles to feature a contemporary setting, KEN explores the conflict between ancient traditions and modern values in a Japanese society torn from its roots. Kazuro Funabashi adapted the story from a work by the controversial Yukio Mishima, supreme chronicler of the agony and ecstasy of ascetic discipline, with Misumi employing tense, black-and-white widescreen compositions to render a dojo a veritable hothouse of rivalry and repression. Led by the impeccably moral, intimidatingly driven head apprentice Kokubu (Raizo Ichikawa), a training camp for young swordsmen is compromised by the jealousy of third-stringer Kagawa (Yusuke Kawazu), who plans to undermine Kokubu and his charges with sensual temptations. One of Misumi’s darkest efforts, KEN is a psychological examination of erotic sublimation and corruption in the guise of a martial-arts film."

Raizo Ichikawa plays the reluctant warrior to perfection in KENKI, the final installment of Kenji Misumi&#39;s Sword Trilogy and, as adapted from another Renzaburo Shibata novel, a brazenly unique hybrid of the samurai, supernatural, and romance genres. Rumored to be the product of a union between a woman and a dog, humble gardener Hanpei (Ichikawa) serves as a low-ranking vassal in the castle of a clan lord (Rokko Toura) slowly succumbing to insanity. While at first ridiculed for his strange origins and reserved nature, Hanpei eventually earns respect for his preternatural running abilities and the vicious sword-drawing technique he learns from a mysterious ronin (Asao Uchida). When the clan is thrown into intensifying disarray and dissension, Hanpei must sacrifice his gentle ways—and his love for the beautiful Saki (Michiko Sugata)—in order to fend for himself. Once more exploring the symbolic possibilities of the chanbara, Misumi plumbs the spiritual duality of the peaceful man forced into violence."

THE KID doesn&#39;t merely show Chaplin at a turning point, when he proved that he was a serious film director, it remains an expressive masterwork of silent cinema. In it, he stars as his lovable Tramp character, this time raising an orphan (a remarkable young Jackie Coogan) he has rescued from the streets.

But when both men discover the wrongdoings of the nefarious clan leader, they side with a band of rebels who are under siege at a remote mountain cabin.

Equally attuned to the world of children and that of adults, Burnett—acting as director, writer, producer, cinematographer, and editor—finds poetry amid everyday struggles in indelible images that glow with compassionate beauty. Largely unseen for decades following its completion in 1977, KILLER OF SHEEP is now recognized as a touchstone of the groundbreaking LA Rebellion movement, and a masterpiece that brought Black American lives to the screen with an aching intimacy like no film before.

A roving film projector repairman (Rüdiger Vogler) saves the life of a depressed psychologist (Hanns Zischler) who has driven his Volkswagen into a river, and they end up on the road together, traveling from one rural German movie theater to another. Along the way, the two men, each running from his past, bond over their shared loneliness. KINGS OF THE ROAD, captured in gorgeous compositions by cinematographer Robby Müller and dedicated to Fritz Lang, is a love letter to the cinema, a moving and funny tale of male friendship, and a portrait of a country still haunted by war."

Starring Raizo Ichikawa, Shiho Fujimara, Shigeru Amachi

An epic chanbara (sword-fighting film) in compact form, KIRU (a.k.a. DESTINY’S SON) depicts the life of Shingo Takakura (Raizo Ichikawa), a master samurai with a mysterious past and an unvanquishable combat technique. When his surrogate father (Shinjiro Asano) is killed by a jealous rival, Shingo learns of his true origin as the abandoned offspring of a female assassin (Shiho Fujimura) and her lover-turned-executioner (Shigeru Amachi). Shingo’s journey through the nineteenth-century Japanese countryside as a twice-orphaned wanderer ultimately lands him in the employ of an honorable shogunate (Eijiro Yanagi) with powerful enemies during a period of political upheaval. As adapted from a Renzaburo Shibata novel by legendary screenwriter Kaneto Shindo, KIRU meditates on the profundity and fragility of father-son relationships, a theme of personal significance to director Kenji Misumi, who suffered from abandonment and rejection from his own father. Misumi’s subtle yet poignant touches result in a minor chanbara masterpiece in which a young man must find his calling, with and without the guidance of a sensei."

Héctor Babenco’s follow-up to his electrifying international breakthrough PIXOTE is another powerful, boldly realized portrait of life on the margins of Brazilian society. Based on the novel by Argentine writer Manuel Puig, KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN features tour de force performances from William Hurt (winner of the Best Actor award at both the Academy Awards and the Cannes Film Festival) and Raúl Juliá as, respectively, the queer, gender-fluid Molina and the leftist radical Valentin, who find themselves imprisoned in the same cell during the Brazilian military dictatorship.

With her Oscar-winning turn in KLUTE, Jane Fonda reinvented herself as a new kind of movie star. Bringing nervy audacity and counterculture style to the role of Bree Daniels—a call girl and aspiring actor who becomes the focal point of a missing-person investigation when detective John Klute (Donald Sutherland) turns up at her door—Fonda made the film her own, putting an independent woman and escort on-screen with a frankness that had not yet been attempted in Hollywood. Suffused with paranoia by the conspiracy-thriller specialist Alan J.

Roman Polanski’s first feature is a brilliant psychological thriller that many critics still consider among his greatest work. The story is simple, yet the implications of its characters’ emotions and actions are profound. When a young hitchhiker joins a couple on a weekend yacht trip, psychological warfare breaks out as the two men compete for the woman’s attention. A storm forces the small crew below deck, and tension builds to a violent climax. With stinging dialogue and a mercilessly probing camera, Polanski creates a disturbing study of fear, humiliation, sexuality, and aggression. This remarkable directorial debut won Polanski worldwide acclaim, a place on the cover of “Time,” and his first Oscar nomination."

Varda and Birkin give the familiar theme of a misunderstood couple searching for a place where their love can survive a provocative twist in this daring romance, in which Birkin (who wrote the story that provided the inspiration for the film) plays a middle-aged woman involved with a fourteen-year-old, video game–obsessed boy (Varda’s son, Mathieu Demy).

Set in the early 1930s, THE LAND urgently portrays the struggle of rural peasants whose livelihood is threatened by a greedy landlord’s scheme to limit their water supply, showing both the power and limitations of resistance in the face of class exploitation. Composed in vivid, sensuous images and shot through with revolutionary fervor, this landmark of Arab cinema—the inaugural entry in Chahine’s so-dubbed Trilogy of Defeat—is a work of both immense humanism and searing political conviction, informed by the burning sensation of collective failure in the wake of the Six-Day War."

Director Juzo Itami applies his unfailingly light touch to that most serious of topics—death—in this slyly self-reflexive, bittersweet comedy. Buhei Mukai (Rentaro Mikuni) is a successful Japanese movie director in his sixties who becomes increasingly ill while working on his latest film. Though his family, friends, and doctor try to keep the secret of his terminal cancer from him, Buhei gradually comes to realize the truth of his condition, leading him on a journey of despair, anger, and, ultimately, acceptance."

Bernardo Bertolucci’s THE LAST EMPEROR won nine Academy Awards, unexpectedly sweeping every category in which it was nominated—quite a feat for a challenging, multilayered epic directed by an Italian and starring an international cast. Yet the power and scope of the film was, and remains, undeniable—the life of Emperor Pu Yi, who took the throne at age three, in 1908, before witnessing decades of cultural and political upheaval, within and without the walls of the Forbidden City. Recreating Ching dynasty China with astonishing detail and unparalleled craftsmanship by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti, THE LAST EMPEROR is also an intimate character study of one man reconciling personal responsibility and political legacy."

Unaware they are caught in a deadly game of deception, a pair of rambunctious swordsmen (Wai Pak and Damian Lau) join forces to help a nobleman (Lau Kong) in his quest for vengeance. Paying thrilling homage to his mentor, martial-arts innovator Chang Cheh, Woo delivers both bravura swordplay set pieces and a bloodstained interrogation of the meaning of brotherhood and honor in a world in which loyalty is bought and sold."

After a decade-long absence, Catherine Breillat triumphantly returns with an exploration of the themes that have made her one of cinema’s most rousing and controversial directors: the ecstasies and wounds of sexuality, and its power to unsettle. A remarkably inscrutable Léa Drucker plays Anne—an attorney advocating for abused minors—who enjoys an enviable lifestyle with her husband, Pierre (Olivier Rabourdin), a milquetoast businessman and ineffectual father to Théo (newcomer Samuel Kircher), his troubled teenage son from a previous marriage. Compelled by her stepson’s Apollonian beauty, Anne embarks on an affair that threatens the stability of her household, along with her professional integrity, as she faces a choice between accountability and deception. Original music by Kim Gordon and radiantly expressionist cinematography by Jeanne Lapoirie heighten the erotic and ethical tensions of LAST SUMMER, Breillat’s latest foray into the outer limits of desire."

A cast of Gallic luminaries—including Mathieu Amalric, Jeanne Balibar, Virginie Ledoyen, Alex Descas, and future director Mia Hansen-Løve (in her film debut)—play a coterie of friends and lovers swirling around the Parisian publishing industry whose romantic, professional, and personal crises are amplified when one of their companions, a neglected novelist (François Cluzet), falls seriously ill.

Suffused with the sense of autumnal melancholy and nostalgia that its title suggests, LATE CHRYSANTHEMUMS is one of director Mikio Naruse’s most perfectly realized works. In a rare starring role, the great Haruko Sugimura (FLOATING WEEDS, TOKYO STORY) portrays Kin, a former geisha who has parlayed her earnings from her erstwhile profession into work as a moneylender; but most of her clients are ex-colleagues of hers, and their lives are not what they once were, nor do any of them have much real chance for happiness. As in many of Naruse’s films, the focus is on the heartbreaking limitations of women’s lives as they see their opportunities constricted by the inexorable passage of time."

This early feature from Chris Marker is a key touchstone in the evolution of his distinctive essayistic style, in which he combines footage shot in the barren reaches of Siberia with his typically idiosyncratic musings. Animated mammoths, a humorous comparison of communist and capitalist values, and even a “commercial” for reindeer all feature in this alternately witty and philosophical travelogue that reveals as much about the history and culture of its subject as it does about the inner workings of its maker’s mind."

The great Soviet director Mikhail Kalatozov, known for his virtuosic, emotionally gripping films, perhaps never made a more visually astonishing one than LETTER NEVER SENT. This absorbing tale of exploration and survival concerns the four members of a geological expedition, who are stranded in the bleak and unforgiving Siberian wilderness while on a mission to find diamonds. Luxuriating in wide-angle beauty and featuring one daring shot after another (the brilliant cinematography is by Kalatozov’s frequent collaborator Sergei Urusevsky), LETTER NEVER SENT is a fascinating piece of cinematic history and a universal adventure of the highest order."

This groundbreaking, long-suppressed look at the effects of war on returning veterans was among the first films to tackle the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder (or as it was then called, “shell shock” or “battle fatigue”). Shot at Mason General Hospital in Brentwood, Long Island, at the end of World War II, LET THERE BE LIGHT follows seventy-five former soldiers suffering debilitating psychological trauma who, in the film’s most dramatic scenes, are given sodium pentothal to recall their horrific experiences in the war. Considered too disturbing and controversial for exhibition, this landmark documentary was suppressed by the military for decades until it finally premiered in New York in 1980."

Two luminaries of French cinema, Claire Denis and Juliette Binoche, unite for the first time in this piercing look at the elusive nature of true love, and the extent to which we are willing to betray ourselves in its pursuit. In a richly layered performance, Binoche plays Isabelle, a successful painter in Paris whose apparent independence belies what she desires most: real romantic fulfillment. Isabelle reveals deep wells of yearning, vulnerability, and resilience as she tumbles into relationships with all the wrong men. Shot in burnished tones by Denis’s longtime collaborator Agnès Godard and featuring a mischievous appearance by Gérard Depardieu, Let the Sunshine In finds bleak humor in a cutting truth: we are all, no matter our age, fools for love."

Considered by many to be the finest British film ever made, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP, by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, is a stirring masterpiece like no other. Roger Livesey dynamically embodies outmoded English militarism as the indelible General Clive Candy, who barely survives four decades of tumultuous British history, 1902 to 1942, only to see the world change irrevocably before his eyes. Anton Walbrook and Deborah Kerr provide unforgettable support, he as a German enemy turned lifelong friend of Candy’s and she as young women of three consecutive generations, a socially committed governess, a sweet-souled war nurse, and a modern-thinking army driver, who inspire him. COLONEL BLIMP is both moving and slyly satirical, an incomparable film about war, love, aging, and obsolescence, shot in gorgeous Technicolor."

In LIFE DURING WARTIME, independent filmmaker Todd Solondz explores contemporary American existence and the nature of forgiveness with his customary dry humor and queasy precision. The film functions as a distorted mirror image of Solondz’s acclaimed 1998 dark comedy HAPPINESS, its emotionally stunted characters now groping for the possibility of change in a post-9/11 world. HAPPINESS’s grim New Jersey setting is transposed mainly to sunny Florida, but the biggest twist is that new actors fill the roles from the earlier film—including Shirley Henderson, Allison Janney, and Ally Sheedy as alarmingly dissimilar sisters, and Ciarán Hinds hauntingly embodying a reformed pedophile. Shot in expressionistic tones by cinematographer extraordinaire Ed Lachman, Solondz’s film finds the humor in the tragic and the tragic in the everyday."

This invigorating film from Mike Leigh was his first international sensation. Melancholy and funny by turns, it is an intimate portrait of a working-class family in a suburb just north of London—an irrepressible mum and dad (Alison Steadman and Jim Broadbent) and their night-and-day twins, a bookish good girl and a troubled, ill-tempered layabout (Claire Skinner and Jane Horrocks). Leigh and his typically brilliant cast create, with extraordinary sensitivity and craft, a vivid, lived-in story of ordinary existence, in which even modest dreams—such as the father’s desire to open a food truck—carry enormous weight."

Made during the last months of Ray’s life as he was dying of cancer, LIGHTNING OVER WATER follows the two filmmakers as they set out to make a narrative film together—a project increasingly threatened by the older director’s failing health and by Wenders’s own ethical crisis over turning his camera on a dying man."

A visually intoxicating queer rhapsody of desire and repression, revenge and redemption unfolds as a deliriously stylized play-within-a-film in this sumptuous cinematic pageant adapted from the stage work by Michel Marc Bouchard. In a Quebec prison in 1952, an aging priest (Marcel Sabourin) sits down to hear the confession of a convict (Aubert Pallascio)—only to have the tables turned on him as the prisoner, aided by his fellow inmates, stages a time- and space-collapsing play that takes them both back to 1912, when they were young men engaged in a tragic love triangle with another boy (Danny Gilmore). Described by director John Greyson as a “strange, Genet-inflected-via-Fellini fable,” this entrancingly beautiful, gender-bending fantasia stands as one of the rapturous peaks of the New Queer Cinema."

An elegant mix of the comic and the tragic, this poignant movie also features Buster Keaton in an extended cameo, marking the only time the two silent comedy icons appeared in a film together.

An astonishing creation, LIMITE is the only feature by the Brazilian director and author Mário Peixoto, made when he was just twenty-two years old. Inspired by a haunting André Kertész photograph on the cover of a French magazine, this avant-garde silent master­piece centers on a man and two women lost at sea, their pasts unfolding through flashbacks propelled by the music of Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, and others.

Starring Marina Pierro, Françoise Blanchard, Mike Marshall

Catherine Valmont (Françoise Blanchard), a wealthy heiress dead before her time, is accidentally reanimated when some unfortunate movers attempt to store drums of chemical waste in the neglected burial vaults below her uninhabited chateau. This “living dead girl” does everything that cinematic convention requires—she kills people, drinks human blood, devours human flesh—yet, for all this, we accept her as an innocent. Meanwhile, the effect that her resurrection has upon her childhood friend Hélène (Marina Pierro) is infinitely more conscious, deliberate, and evil. Bloodier and more violent than his own tastes preferred, THE LIVING DEAD GIRL forced legendary cult director Jean Rollin to work against the grain in his own preferred genre—and he transformed himself in the process, yielding an intense, emotionally incendiary experience more extreme than nearly anything else in his body of work."

A superstitious farming family is hesitant to use its fields to grow crops to help feed the nation&#39;s troops.

A country’s bloody history stains the present in the Guatemalan auteur Jayro Bustamante’s transfixing fusion of folk horror and searing political commentary, inspired by the real-life indictment of the authoritarian Efraín Ríos Montt for crimes against humanity. A notorious, now aging former military dictator stands trial for atrocities committed against Guatemala’s Maya communities. While battling legal repercussions and the people’s demands for justice, he and his family are plagued by a series of increasingly strange and disturbing occurrences, seemingly brought on by an enigmatic new housekeeper (María Mercedes Coroy). With a restraint that renders the film’s shocks all the more potent, Bustamante crafts a chilling vision of a nation reckoning with collective harms and the restless ghosts of a past that refuses to die."

Starring Ivor Novello, June Tripp

With his third feature film, THE LODGER: A STORY OF THE LONDON FOG, Alfred Hitchcock took a major step toward greatness and made what he would come to consider his true directorial debut. This haunting silent thriller tells the tale of a mysterious young man (matinee idol Ivor Novello) who takes up residence at a London boardinghouse just as a killer known as the Avenger descends upon the city, preying on blonde women. The film is animated by the palpable energy of a young stylist at play, decisively establishing the director’s formal and thematic obsessions.

Jacques Demy’s crystalline debut gave birth to the fictional universe in which so many of his characters would live, play, and love. It’s among his most profoundly felt films, a tale of crisscrossing lives in Nantes (Demy’s hometown) that floats on waves of longing and desire. Heading the film’s ensemble is the enchanting Anouk Aimée as the title character, a cabaret chanteuse who’s awaiting the return of a long-lost lover and unwilling to entertain the adoration of another love-struck soul, the wanderer Roland (Marc Michel).

Germany in the autumn of 1957: Lola (Barbara Sukowa), a seductive cabaret singer–prostitute, exults in her power as a tempter of men, but she wants more—money, property, and love. Pitting a corrupt building contractor (Mario Adorf) against the new straight-arrow building commissioner (Armin Mueller-Stahl), Lola launches an outrageous plan to elevate herself in a world where everything—and everyone—is for sale.

The seemingly simple premise is rendered anything but by Muratova’s dreamy, drifting style, with off-kilter framing, editing, and dialogue continually pushing cinema’s aesthetic and expressive boundaries outward."

In the hands of the renowned experimental theater director Peter Brook, William Golding’s legendary novel about the primitivism lurking beneath civilization becomes a film as raw and ragged as the lost boys at its center. Taking an innovative documentary-like approach, Brook shot LORD OF THE FLIES with an off-the-cuff naturalism, seeming to record a spontaneous eruption of its characters’ ids. The result is a rattling masterpiece, as provocative as its source material."

Starring Seret Scott, Bill Gunn, Duane Jones

One of the first feature films directed by an African American woman, Kathleen Collins’s LOSING GROUND tells the story of a marriage between two remarkable people, both at a crossroads in their lives. Sara Rogers (Seret Scott), a black professor of philosophy, is embarking on an intellectual quest to understand “ecstasy” just as her painter husband, Victor (Bill Gunn), sets off on a more earthy exploration of joy. Over the course of a summer idyll in upstate New York, the two each experience profound emotional and romantic awakenings. Applying a deft comic touch to a deeply personal exploration of love, race, and gender, Collins crafts a charming, complex tale of personal discovery that, after decades of neglect, has reemerged as a still-fresh landmark of independent cinema."

“We’ve met before, haven’t we?” A mesmerizing meditation on the mysterious nature of identity, LOST HIGHWAY, David Lynch’s seventh feature film, is one of the filmmaker’s most potent cinematic dreamscapes. Starring Patricia Arquette and Bill Pullman, the film expands the horizons of the medium, taking its audience on a journey through the unknown and the unknowable.

When a young woman spends the night with an alleged terrorist, her quiet, ordered life falls into ruins. THE LOST HONOR OF KATHARINA BLUM portrays an anxious era in West Germany amid a crumbling postwar political consensus. Katharina, though apparently innocent, suddenly becomes a suspect, falling prey to a vicious smear campaign by the police and a ruthless tabloid journalist that tests the limits of her dignity and her sanity. Crafting one of the most accessible and direct works of 1970s political filmmaking, Volker Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta deliver a powerful adaptation of Heinrich Böll’s novel, a stinging commentary on state power, individual freedom, and media manipulation that is as relevant today as when it was released."

Perhaps the most abstract of the director’s sister-themed films, the made-for-television LOST IS NEW YORK dials back the horror for which Rollin was best known and instead unfolds as a kind of art-house “Alice in Wonderland” in which two siblings are transported from the French beachside the wastelands of Manhattan."

As beguiling a raconteur as he is a performer, Louie makes for a wildly entertaining movie subject, and Zwigoff honors him with an unsentimental but endlessly affectionate tribute.

Huppert is Nelly, a well-to-do woman who chucks her comfortable but dull marriage for a fling with Depardieu’s bad-boy petty criminal Loulou, who introduces her to the allure of the gutter.

Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer are chic strangers who meet and fall in love aboard an ocean liner bound for New York. Though they are both involved with other people, they make a pact to reconnect six months later at the top of the Empire State Building—until the hand of fate throws their star-crossed affair tragically off course. Swooning passion and gentle comedy coexist in perfect harmony in the exquisitely tender LOVE AFFAIR (nominated for six Oscars), a story so timeless that it has been remade by multiple filmmakers over the years—including McCarey himself, who updated it as the no less beloved AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER."

What emerges is both a kaleidoscopic cross section of faces and places—from the industrialized cities of the North to the rural villages of the South—and an incisive portrait of a society where, despite the rapid modernization brought on by the postwar “economic miracle,” hypocrisy, repression, and conformism still hold sway."

While many of her most famous novels—including “Strangers on a Train,” “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” and the partly autobiographical lesbian love story “The Price of Salt”—were adapted into acclaimed films, Highsmith herself was forced to lead a double life and had to hide her vibrant same-sex affairs from her family and the public.

In 1932, she is the daughter of a bourgeois family drawn into the workers’ uprising against the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado. And in the postrevolutionary 1960s, she is a newlywed farm girl fighting against patriarchal oppression. A formally dazzling landmark of postcolonial cinema, LUCÍA is both a senses-stunning visual experience and a fiercely feminist portrait of a society journeying toward liberation."

A shimmering glass hotel at the top of a remote Provençal mountain provides the setting for a tragicomic tapestry about an obsessive love pentangle, whose principals range from an artist to a hotel manager to a dam worker. Scripted by Jacques Prévert and Pierre Laroche, the film was banned from theaters for the duration of the occupation for its dark portrayal of the hedonistic excesses of the ruling class.

Investigating revolutionary Patrice Lumumba’s brief tenure as the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as the machinations behind his shocking assassination, legendary Haitian filmmaker Raoul Peck (I AM NOT YOUR NEGRO) discovers critical flashpoints where a nation’s officially curated narratives intersect with repressed truths. At eight years old, Peck was brought by his family to the newly independent DRC, where his father worked for the United Nations as an agricultural professor and his mother served as secretary to the mayor of Kinshasa. Sifting through his childhood recollections and interviewing Belgian journalists and politicians who witnessed the country’s descent into internecine violence, Peck fashions a prismatic meditation on the elusiveness of political objectivity and the ethics of personal remembrance in chronicling the traumas of history."

Directed by Agnieska Smoczyńska • 2015 • Poland
Starring Kinga Preis, Michalina Olszańska, Marta Mazurek

This genre-defying horror-musical mash-up—the bold debut of Polish director Agnieszka Smoczyńska—follows a pair of carnivorous mermaid sisters drawn ashore to explore life on land in an alternate 1980s Poland. Their tantalizing siren songs and otherworldly auras make them overnight sensations as nightclub singers in the half-glam, half-decrepit world of Smoczyńska’s imagining. The director gives fierce teeth to her viscerally sensual, darkly feminist twist on Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid,” in which the girls’ bond is tested and their survival threatened after one sister falls for a human. A coming-of-age fairy tale with a catchy synth-fueled soundtrack, outrageous song-and-dance numbers, and lavishly grimy sets, THE LURE explores its themes of emerging female sexuality, exploitation, and the compromises of adulthood with savage energy and originality."

The themes, images, and cultural vernacular of Victor Fleming’s THE WIZARD OF OZ continue to haunt David Lynch’s filmography—from his early short THE ALPHABET to his recent television series TWIN PEAKS: THE RETURN. Arguably, no filmmaker has so consistently drawn inspiration—consciously or unconsciously—from a single work. Is Lynch trapped in the Land of Oz? If so, what can we learn about his body of work by taking a closer look at how it intersects and communicates with that legendary fantasy? In turn, what do Lynch’s films have to say about the enduring resonance of one of America’s most beloved classics? Through six distinct perspectives, Alexandre O. Philippe’s LYNCH/OZ helps us reexperience and reinterpret THE WIZARD OF OZ by way of David Lynch, delivering new appreciations of both.

Over a booze-fueled, increasingly hectic five-day shoot in East Hampton, Norman Mailer and his cast and crew spontaneously unloaded onto film the lurid and loony chronicle of U.S. presidential candidate and filmmaker Norman T. Kingsley debating and attacking his hangers-on and enemies.

By land, by sea, by air . . .

With the boundlessness of human adaptability as its lodestar, MAINE-OCÉAN EXPRESS covers a delirious swath of narrative ground, including the roundabout path that returns a hapless train conductor (Bernard Ménez) to his duties after he joins an impromptu samba session and nearly becomes “the next Maurice Chevalier.” Applying his long-take shooting style to a plot of episodic, anarchic zaniness, Rozier once more proves himself a master of making the patently absurd appear completely realistic, and vice versa."

The two oldest have been married for some time, but according to tradition, the rebellious youngest sister cannot wed until the third, conservative and terribly shy, finds a husband.

With its low budget and lush black-and-white imagery, Gus Van Sant’s debut feature MALA NOCHE heralded an idiosyncratic, provocative new voice in American independent film. Set in Van Sant’s hometown of Portland, Oregon, the film evokes a world of transient workers, dead-end day-shifters, and bars and seedy apartments bathed in a profound nighttime, as it follows a romantic deadbeat with a wayward crush on a handsome Mexican immigrant. MALA NOCHE was an important prelude to the New Queer Cinema of the nineties and is a fascinating capsule from a time and place that continues to haunt its director’s work."

More than a tailor, she is the confidant of her customers and community. But when it starts pouring and the rain threatens to flood her workshop—one of many misfortunes—Pierrette will have to struggle to stay afloat. Marked by moments of everyday beauty and quiet grace, Mbakam’s naturalistic approach yields a quietly affecting portrait of resilience in the face of adversity and socioeconomic hardship."

Directed by Lino Brocka • 1975 • Philippines
Starring Hilda Koronel, Rafael Roco Jr., Lou Salvador Jr.

Lino Brocka achieved international acclaim with this candid portrait of 1970s Manila, a breakout example of the more serious-minded filmmaking the director had turned to after building a career on mainstream movies he described as “soaps.” A young fisherman from a provincial village arrives in the capital on a quest to track down his girlfriend, who was lured there with the promise of work and hasn’t been heard from since. In the meantime, he takes a low-wage job at a construction site and witnesses life on the streets, where death strikes without warning, corruption and exploitation are commonplace, and protests hint at escalating civil unrest. Mixing visceral, documentary-like realism with the narrative focus of Hollywood noir and melodrama, MANILA IN THE CLAWS OF LIGHT is a howl of anguish from one of the most celebrated figures in Philippine cinema.

This tale of treachery put both the Gainsborough melodrama and actor James Mason on the map. The star-to-be plays Lord Rohan, a cruel nobleman who marries the naive and sweet-natured Clarissa (Phyllis Calvert) for the sole purpose of producing an heir; meanwhile, Clarissa&#39;s conniving best friend, Hesther (Margaret Lockwood), plots against her for her own nefarious ends. THE MAN IN GREY, directed by Leslie Arliss, was such a box-office success that Gainsborough used it as a template, launching a cycle of increasingly rococo films.

Man Is Not a Bird is an antic, free-form portrait of the love lives of two less-than-heroic men who labor in a copper factory. For this first feature, following years of making documentaries and experimental shorts, Dusan Makavejev and his crew set up shop in Bor, a mining town in the mountains near Yugoslavia&#39;s border with Bulgaria, interviewing the workers in the region and even shooting footage inside the local ore factories. Yet the result is hardly a staid tribute to the working class. Also featuring seductive Milena Dravic, who would go on to star in Makavejev&#39;s groundbreaking WR: Mysteries of the Organism, Man Is Not a Bird is one of cinema&#39;s most assured and daring debuts."

Back in his home country of Pakistan, Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi, elements of whose own life story were woven into the script) was a famous rock star. Now a widower separated from his son and adrift in New York, he works long hours selling coffee and bagels from a Midtown Manhattan food cart, engaged in a Sisyphean search for human connection and a sense of purpose that seems perpetually just out of reach. A rare immigrant’s-eye view of a post-9/11 city suffused with subtle paranoia and xenophobia, MAN PUSH CART gives at once empathetic and clear-eyed expression to the everyday drama of human endurance."

Here, Mapplethorpe begins photographing the hotel’s inhabitants and his newfound circle of friends, including artists and musicians, socialites, film stars, and members of the gay S&amp;amp;M underground. Exploring the intersection of his art and his sexuality along with his struggle for mainstream recognition, MAPPLETHORPE offers a nuanced portrait of an artist at the height of his craft and of the self-destructive impulses that threatened to undermine it all."

Vláčil’s approach was to re-create the textures and mentalities of a long-ago way of life, rather than to make a conventional historical drama, and the result is dazzling.

Robert Altman’s distinctive genius first announced itself with this innovative, smash-hit black comedy in which a pair of irreverent surgeons (Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould) at a mobile army hospital stationed on the front lines of the Korean War stave off the everyday horrors they witness through their havoc-wreaking high jinks. The director’s stylistic trademarks—the overlapping dialogue, loose-limbed approach to narrative, and nimble marshaling of a sprawling ensemble cast—helped to create a pop-culture sensation that spoke to the unruly zeitgeist of Vietnam-era America."

There, she confronts her complex feelings about the woman who raised her, her homeland, and the first, seemingly impossible love she was forced to leave behind. A sensorially rich, psychologically immersive exploration of desire, dislocation, and the journey toward healing, Olive Nwosu’s tour-de-force short exists on a dreamy, drifting wavelength all its own."

Twenty years after their brilliant cinema-theater experiment VANYA ON 42ND STREET, Wallace Shawn and André Gregory reunited to produce another idiosyncratic film version of a classic play, this time Henrik Ibsen’s “Bygmester Solness” (“Master Builder Solness”). Brought pristinely to the screen by Jonathan Demme, this compellingly abstract reimagining features Shawn (who also wrote the adaptation) as a visionary but tyrannical middle-aged architect haunted by figures from his past, most acutely an attractive, vivacious young woman (the breathtaking newcomer Lisa Joyce) who has appeared on his doorstep. Also featuring standout supporting performances by Julie Hagerty, Larry Pine, and Gregory, A MASTER BUILDER, like VANYA, is the result of many years of rehearsals, a living, breathing, constantly shifting work that unites theater, film, and dream."

Before he turned to the story of Joan of Arc, the Danish cinema genius Carl Theodor Dreyer fashioned this ahead-of-its-time examination of domestic life. A deft comedy of gentle revenge, it is the story of a housewife who, with the help of a wily nanny, turns the tables on her tyrannical husband. In it, Dreyer combines lightness and humor with his customary meticulous craft and sense of integrity.

Yet despite her transgressions, Kaurismäki makes Iris a compelling, even sympathetic figure.

While they take hesitant steps toward romance, Richard’s sons follow their own curiosity toward their first sexual experiences, online and in real life, venturing into uncharted territories in their attempts to connect with others. Playful and profoundly transgressive, ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW is a poetic look at the tortuous routes we take to intimacy in an isolating world, and the moments of magic and redemption that unite us."

A slow-burning depiction of economic degradation in Thatcher’s England, Mike Leigh’s MEANTIME is the culmination of the writer-director’s pioneering work in television. Unemployment is rampant in London’s working-class East End, where a middle-aged couple and their two sons languish in a claustrophobic public-housing flat. As the brothers (Phil Daniels and Tim Roth) grow increasingly disaffected, Leigh punctuates the grinding boredom of their daily existence with tense encounters, including with a priggish aunt (Marion Bailey) who has managed to become middle-class and a blithering skinhead on the verge of psychosis (a scene-stealing Gary Oldman, in his first major role). Informed by Leigh’s now trademark improvisational process and propelled by the lurching rhythms of its Beckett-like dialogue, MEANTIME is an unrelenting, often blisteringly funny look at life on the dole."

The simple premise—four thirtysomethings convene for a wine-fueled dinner party that turns increasingly intimate as they discuss everything from religion and ghosts to relationships and sexual fetishes—is rendered, in Odenkirk’s deft hands, consistently insightful and surprising, while a host of cameos (look out for everyone from David Cross to Jenna Fischer) keeps things lively."

Directed by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea • 1968 • Cuba
Starring Sergio Corrieri, Daisy Granados, Omar Valdés

This film by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea is the most renowned work in the history of Cuban cinema. After his wife and family flee in the wake of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the bourgeois intellectual Sergio (Sergio Corrieri) passes his days wandering Havana in idle reflection, his amorous entanglements and political ambivalence gradually giving way to a mounting sense of alienation. With this adaptation of an innovative novel by Edmundo Desnoes, Gutiérrez Alea developed a cinematic style as radical as the times he was chronicling, creating a collage of vivid impressions through the use of experimental editing techniques, archival material, and spontaneously shot street scenes. Intimate and densely layered, MEMORIES OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT provides an indictment of its protagonist’s disengagement and an extraordinary glimpse of life in postrevolutionary Cuba.

Elaine May crafted a gangster film like no other in the nocturnal odyssey MIKEY AND NICKY, capitalizing on the chemistry between frequent collaborators John Cassavetes and Peter Falk by casting them together as small-time mobsters whose lifelong relationship has turned sour. Set over the course of one night, this restless drama finds Nicky (Cassavetes) holed up in a hotel after the boss he stole money from puts a hit out on him. Terrified, he calls on Mikey (Falk), the one person he thinks can save him. Scripted to match the live-wire energy of its stars—alongside supporting players Ned Beatty, Joyce Van Patten, and Carol Grace—and inspired by real-life characters from May’s own childhood, this unbridled portrait of male friendship turned tragic is an unsung masterpiece of American cinema."

This portrait of renowned percussionist and founding pioneer of avant-garde jazz Milford Graves finds him exploring his kaleidoscopic creativity and relentless curiosity. The film draws the viewer through the artist’s lush garden and ornate home, into the martial arts dojo in his backyard and the laboratory in his basement—all just blocks from where he grew up in the housing projects of South Jamaica, Queens. Graves tells stories of discovery, struggle, and survival, ruminates on the essence of “swing,” activates electronic stethoscopes in his basement lab to process the sound of his heart, and travels to Japan to perform at a school for children with autism. Oscillating from present to past and weaving intimate glimpses of the artist’s complex cosmology with blistering performances, MILFORD GRAVES FULL MANTIS is cinema full of fluidity, polyrhythm, and intensity, embodying the essence of Graves’s music."

Filmmaker, writer, and poet Milisuthando Bongela’s youth in South Africa was untouched by the horrors of apartheid—at least that’s how it seemed. The Transkei, an unrecognized Black independent region established by the regime, created the illusion for Black South Africans that separate could be equal. And paradoxically for Bongela, life in the Transkei proved as idyllic as the propaganda claimed. Until it was over. The fall of apartheid ushered in a new life, one that included, for the first time, whiteness. MILISUTHANDO is a deeply intimate portrait of past, present, and future South Africa, blending poetry, film, and photography into a striking cinematic essay. Bongela explores love, friendship, and belonging in a South Africa stratified by racism—proving that only if we understand its tentacles can we begin to extricate ourselves from its clutches."

In a richly textured collage of varying film stocks and newsreel footage, the recollections of a dying poet flash before our eyes, his dreams mingling with scenes of childhood, wartime, and marriage, all imbued with the mystical power of a trance.

They will be monitored and displayed on television for six months in a model apartment outfitted with state-of-the-art products and nonstop surveillance - the template for &#39;a new city for the new man.&#39; A searing satire of the breakdown of individual freedoms in the face of increasing governmental invasions of privacy, William Klein&#39;s THE MODEL COUPLE deftly investigates the fine line between democracy and totalitarianism."

MODERN TIMES, Charlie Chaplin’s last outing as the Little Tramp, puts the iconic character to work as a giddily inept factory employee who becomes smitten with a gorgeous gamine (Paulette Goddard). With its barrage of unforgettable gags and sly commentary on class struggle during the Great Depression, MODERN TIMES—though made almost a decade into the talkie era and containing moments of sound (even song!)—is a timeless showcase of Chaplin’s untouchable genius as a director of silent comedy."

The recurring theme of dance once again works its way into a Shirley Clarke project, as this short film features a performance that takes place across a multitude of environments.

THE MOMENT OF TRUTH (IL MOMENTO DELLA VERITÀ), from director Francesco Rosi, is a visceral plunge into the life of a famous torero—played by real-life bullfighting legend Miguel Mateo, known as Miguelín. Charting his rise and fall with a single-minded focus on the bloody business at hand, the film is at once gritty and operatic, placing the viewer right in the thick of the ring’s action, as close to death as possible. Like all of the great Italian truth seeker’s films, this is not just an electrifying drama but also a profound and moving inquiry into a violent world—and it’s perhaps the greatest bullfighting movie ever made."

The brilliant breakthrough film by writer-director Neil Jordan journeys into the dark heart of the London underworld to weave a gripping, noir-infused love story. Bob Hoskins received a multitude of honors—including an Oscar nomination—for his touchingly vulnerable, not-so-tough-guy portrayal of George, recently released from prison and hired by a sinister mob boss (Michael Caine) to chauffeur call girl Simone (Cathy Tyson, in a celebrated performance) between high-paying clients. George’s fascination with the elegant, enigmatic Simone leads him on a dangerous quest through the city’s underbelly, where love is a weakness to be exploited and betrayed. Jordan’s colorful dialogue and eye for evocatively surreal details lend a dreamlike sheen to MONA LISA, an unconventionally romantic tale of damaged people searching for tenderness in an unforgiving world."

Through an audacious, two-part narrative structure, Gopalakrishnan evokes the fractured psyche of Ajayan (Ashokan), a brilliant but troubled man who narrates two conflicting accounts of his life—about growing up as an orphan, about his turbulent youth, and about his complicated experiences of love and desire—leaving it to viewers to decipher what is truth and what is delusion."

Slapstick prevails again when Jacques Tati’s eccentric, old-fashioned hero, Monsieur Hulot, is set loose in Villa Arpel, the geometric, oppressively ultramodern home of his brother-in-law, and in the antiseptic plastic hose factory where he gets a job. The second Hulot movie and Tati’s first color film, MON ONCLE is a supremely amusing satire of mechanized living and consumer society that earned the director the Academy Award for best foreign-language film."

Delicate, naturalistic, and tinged with a striking mix of nostalgia and menace, MON ONCLE ANTOINE follows Benoit, as he first encounters the twin terrors of sex and death, and his fellow villagers, who are living under the thumb of the local asbestos mine owner. Set during one ominous Christmas, MON ONCLE ANTOINE is a holiday film unlike any other, and an authentically detailed illustration of childhood’s twilight."

Charlie Chaplin plays shockingly against type in his most controversial film, a brilliant and bleak black comedy about money, marriage, and murder. Chaplin is a twentieth-century bluebeard, an enigmatic family man who goes to extreme lengths to support his wife and child, attempting to bump off a series of wealthy widows (including one played by the indefatigable Martha Raye, in a hilarious performance).

Monterey featured career-making performances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Otis Redding, but they were just a few of the performers in a wildly diverse lineup that included Simon and Garfunkel, the Mamas and the Papas, the Who, the Byrds, Hugh Masekela, and the extraordinary Ravi Shankar. With his characteristic vérité style—and a camera crew that included the likes of Albert Maysles and Richard Leacock—D. A.

In his long-unavailable body of work, ranging from documentaries about his native village to closely autobiographical narrative films, Eustache pioneered a forthright and fearless brand of realism. The pinnacle of this innovative style, THE MOTHER AND THE WHORE follows Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a Parisian pseudo-intellectual who lives with his tempestuous girlfriend, Marie (Bernadette Lafont), even as he begins a dalliance with the sexually liberated Veronika (Françoise Lebrun), leading the three into an emotionally turbulent love triangle.

In this contemplation on the meanings of movement in the experience of migration, the grace and skill of a Filipina domestic worker are juxtaposed with devotional dances to the Santo Niño statue that Magellan brought to the islands in 1521. The ensuing galleon trade of silk and porcelain for New World silver initiated the global economy, and the cycle in which female care labor is now the commodity in demand."

Clumsy Harold Hall (Harold Lloyd) is a young movie fan with a burning desire to be in pictures—but no real acting experience or ability. A mix-up in the casting office, however, brings him one step closer to his dream of stardom when he’s invited to make a screen test in Hollywood—where he proceeds to wreak hilarious havoc all across the studio backlot. Lloyd’s third talkie became his most commercially successful thanks to the clever use of sound and ingenious gags conceived in part by “Nancy” cartoonist Ernie Bushmiller."

When her parents split and her father (Kiichi Nakai) moves out of their family home, Renko (Tomoko Tabata), a bright and energetic sixth-grade girl, is left alone with her mother, Nazuna (Junko Sakurada), in Kyoto. As Nazuna sets out new rules for their life together, Renko makes plans of her own, and sees to it that any changes happening in her family happen on her terms. Filled with indelible images, this beloved coming-of-age film from Shinji Somai is a poignant family drama that transcends the tropes of divorce stories to bring us an emotionally layered portrait of a complex teenage girl who encounters the unknown and refuses to succumb to it."

A destructive, arrogant patriot in tight pants, Freedom joins forces with Marie Madeleine (a satirically sexy Delphine Seyrig) to combat lefty freethinkers, as well as the insidious evildoers Moujik Man and inflatable Red China Man, culminating in a star-spangled showdown of kitschy excess.

In perhaps the finest performance of his career, Alain Delon stars as the wealthy Robert Klein, an amoral art dealer in Nazi-occupied Paris who exploits the persecution of his Jewish countrymen by buying and selling their paintings. When Klein is mistaken for a Jewish man of the same name, he is plunged into a labyrinthine identity crisis with life-or-death consequences.

The film that, along with producer Sammo Hung’s SPOOKY ENCOUNTERS, launched an entire hopping-vampire horror-comedy subgenre is Hong Kong cinema at its most gleefully inventive and gloriously unrestrained. The franchise’s recurring star Lam Ching-Ying plays a unibrowed Taoist priest who, when a bloodthirsty revivified corpse pogoes its way out of the grave and begins terrorizing his town, must use a mix of magic and kung fu to stop the mayhem.

Here, supernatural hijinks ensue when an archaeologist inadvertently awakens an ancient vampire family, sending the revivified mom, dad, and son on a rip-roaring rampage—with much hilarity provided by the epic, slow-motion centerpiece fight sequence.

He’ll have to summon real powers, though, to deal with an evil witch (Pauline Wong Yuk-Wan) whose supernatural bandits are terrorizing a village.

Though it is the only installment in the series not to feature regular star Lam Ching-Ying, MR. VAMPIRE IV delivers more than enough zany-spooky pleasures to make it yet another worthy follow-up."

Made on a shoestring budget in Waters’ native Baltimore, with the filmmaker taking on nearly every technical task, this gleeful mockery of the peace-and-love ethos of its era features the Cavalcade of Perversion, a traveling show mounted by a troupe of misfits whose shocking proclivities are topped only by those of their leader: the glammer-than-glam, larger-than-life Divine, out for blood after discovering her lover’s affair. Starring Waters’ beloved regular cast the Dreamlanders (including David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Mink Stole, Susan Lowe, George Figgs, and Cookie Mueller), MULTIPLE MANIACS is an anarchic masterwork from an artist who has doggedly tested the limits of good taste for decades."

In a Cameroon village, the rigid customs governing courtship and marriage mean that a betrothed couple, though deeply in love, can be torn apart by the lack of a dowry and another man’s claiming the young woman—a rupture that sets the stage for a clash between a patriarchal society and a modern generation. Luminous black-and-white cinematography and stylistic flourishes yield images of haunting power in this potent depiction, told via flashback, of the challenges of postcolonialism and the devastating consequences of a community’s refusal to deviate from tradition."

The always luminous Delphine Seyrig stars as an antique shop owner and widow in Boulogne-sur-Mer, whose past comes back to haunt her when a former lover reenters her life. Meanwhile, her stepson is tormented by his own ghosts, related to his service in France&#39;s recently ended war in Algeria.

Headstrong young Sybylla Melvyn (Judy Davis, in a star-making performance), bemoans her stifling life in the backcountry, where her writerly ambitions receive little encouragement, and craves independence above all else. When a handsome landowner (Sam Neill), disarmed by her unruly charms, begins to court her, Sybylla must decide whether she can reconcile the prospect of marriage with the illustrious life’s work she has imagined for herself.

With his best friend just getting out of jail and his brother busy planning a wedding to a snooty upper-middle-class black woman, Pierce navigates his conflicting obligations while trying to figure out what he really wants in life."

Jean-Pierre Gorin&#39;s gripping and unique film about a Samoan street gang in Long Beach, California, is, like other works by the filmmaker, a probing look at a closed community with its own rules, rituals, and language. Part observational documentary, part fiction invisibly scripted and shaped by the director, My Crasy Life, which won a special jury prize at Sundance, is an enthralling and intensely focused contemplation of violence and dislocation."

In this captivating and philosophical film directed by Louis Malle, actor and playwright Wallace Shawn sits down with his friend the theater director André Gregory at a restaurant on New York’s Upper West Side, and the pair proceed through an alternately whimsical and despairing confessional about love, death, money, and all the superstition in between. Playing variations on their own New York–honed personas, Shawn and Gregory, who also cowrote the screenplay, dive in with introspective intellectual gusto, and Malle captures it all with a delicate, artful detachment. A fascinating freeze-frame of cosmopolitan culture, MY DINNER WITH ANDRÉ remains a unique work in cinema history."

Patrick Tam, perhaps the Hong Kong New Wave’s most daring modernist and a crucial influence on Wong Kar Wai, teams with cinematographer Christopher Doyle, a regular Wong collaborator, for a stylish “heroic bloodshed” melodrama starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Kenny Bee, and Joey Wong as three friends bound together by ties both criminal and romantic. With deliriously pulpy plotting, a synth-heavy score, luxuriously expressionistic imagery, and a climactic bloodbath for the ages, MY HEART IS THAT ETERNAL ROSE exists somewhere at the intersection of Wong’s cinema of longing and John Woo’s cinema of wrathful vengeance, standing as one of the high-water marks of Hong Kong crime cinema."

There, with the help of the warmhearted eccentrics who populate the town, the boy finds both refuge from his misfortunes and unexpected adventure.

Living with his grandmother (Jacqueline Dufranne) in a sleepy village outside Bordeaux, Daniel enjoys a carefree existence with his similarly innocent, though often mischievous, peers. But when his mother (Ingrid Caven) arrives and relocates him to Narbonne, Daniel is prematurely thrust into adulthood: pulled out of school, he is forced to work for a surly mechanic and, left to his own devices, falls in with an older crowd that is far more experienced in dating and sex. Featuring a wonderfully nuanced performance by Loeb, MY LITTLE LOVES is a coming-of-age gem surpassed only by Eustache’s own earlier masterpiece, THE MOTHER AND THE WHORE."

Though not the main star, Chan lights up the screen in the film’s most exhilarating set pieces: a kinetic amusement-park-set opening and a surreal haunted-house finale, both stylishly and creatively staged by director-star Hung."

Combining elements of horror, hostage drama, and police procedural with an undercurrent of mordant comedy, MY SON, MY SON, WHAT HAVE YE DONE plays like a diabolical meeting point between Herzogian eccentricity and Lynchian surrealism."

Apichatpong Weerasethakul brought an appetite for experimentation to Thai cinema with his debut feature, an uncategorizable work that refracts documentary impressions of his homeland through the surrealist concept of the exquisite corpse game. Enlisting locals to contribute improvised narration to a simple tale, Apichatpong charts the collective construction of the fiction as each new encounter imbues it with unpredictable shades of fantasy and pathos. Shot over the course of two years in 16 mm black and white, MYSTERIOUS OBJECT AT NOON established the director’s fascination with the porous boundaries between the real and the imagined.

In 1955, Henri-Georges Clouzot joined forces with his friend Pablo Picasso to make an entirely new kind of art film, “a film that could capture the moment and the mystery of creativity.” Together, they devised an innovative technique: the filmmaker placed his camera behind a semitransparent surface on which the artist drew with special inks that bled through. Clouzot thus captured a perfect reverse image of Picasso’s brushstrokes, turning the motion-picture screen into the artist’s canvas. Here, the master creates, and sometimes obliterates, twenty works (most of them, in fact, destroyed after the shoot), ranging from playful black-and-white sketches to vivid color murals. Exhilarating, mesmerizing, enchanting, and unforgettable, THE MYSTERY OF PICASSO is simply one of the greatest documentaries on art ever made."

NASHVILLE weaves the stories of twenty-four characters—from country star to wannabe to reporter to waitress—into a cinematic tapestry that is equal parts comedy, tragedy, and musical. Many members of the astonishing cast wrote their own songs and performed them live on location, which lends another layer to the film’s quirky authenticity. Altman’s ability to get to the heart of American life via its eccentric byways was never put to better use than in this grand, rollicking triumph, which barrels forward to an unforgettable conclusion."

Starring Carl Lumbly, Tommy Hicks, James Opher

Nat Turner’s slave rebellion is a watershed event in America’s long and troubled history of slavery and racial conflict. NAT TURNER: A TROUBLESOME PROPERTY tells the story of that violent confrontation and of the ways that story has been continuously retold during the years since 1831. To emphasize the fictive aspect of historical reconstruction, the film adopts an innovative structure: interspersing documentary footage and interviews with dramatizations of different versions of the story, using a new actor to represent Nat Turner in each version. As literary critic Henry Louis Gates explains in the film, “There is no Nat Turner to recover; you have to create the man and his voice.”"

One of the most explosively controversial films of the 1990s, Oliver Stone’s savagely satirical look at the relationship between violence and the American media—adapted from a story Quentin Tarantino—unfolds through the eyes of Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (Juliette Lewis), lovers who embark on a berserk cross-country killing spree that turns them into popular antiheroes in the eyes of a voracious tabloid media and a public riveted by their saga. With its hyperkinetic editing, hallucinatory shifts between color and black and white, and shocking violence, NATURAL BORN KILLERS stands as one of the most audacious auteur statements of its era."

In this fascinating and gently comic documentary, director Mark Lewis delves into the under-recognized complexities of this seemingly simple animal. Through interviews with those who have formed unique bonds with chickens and narrative vignettes depicting the birds at their magical best, Lewis allows us to rethink our relationship to a creature we have previously taken for granted, while at the same time providing a lens through which we can view ourselves anew."

Ultimately, what emerges is a thought-provoking work that calls into question issues of “insider/outsider” status in a portrait of an assimilated Navajo struggling to use a “white man’s” medium to capture the remnants of her cultural past."

Buster Keaton sets sail for misadventure in what would prove to be his biggest commercial hit, a slapstick riot that makes ingenious use of its setting: a 500-foot, lost-at-sea steamship. Here, Buster stars as Rollo Treadway, a spoiled rich boy who’s got plenty of dollars but no common sense.

Starring Caroline Cartier, Françoise Guégan, Danièle Croisy 

In early September, three young Parisians—Caroline (Caroline Cartier), her cousin Kareen (Françoise Guégan), and Joëlle (Danièle Croisy)—travel to the sparsely populated shorefront town of Orouët for a carefree holiday. At the house of Caroline’s mother, the trio soon take in Joëlle’s boss Gilbert (Bernard Ménez), and romantic complications inevitably ensue: ever the schlemiel, Gilbert suffers subtle humiliations at the women’s hands in order to remain close to Joëlle, his crush, while Joëlle develops feelings for Patrick (Patrick Verde), a handsome, sporty neighbor who in turn flirts with Kareen. Jacques Rozier constructs his love triangle (or, rather, square) without an ounce of melodrama, focusing as much on the vacation’s languorous atmosphere—and its giddy effect on the friends’ inside jokes and childish slapstick—as on the slow-burn plot. Perfectly capturing both the liberating promise and the melancholic effervescence of summer, NEAR OROUËT is a minor masterpiece of the post–New Wave era and a beautiful meditation on the fleeting nature of youth, love, and time."

The film’s unusually hard-eyed realism was born of Lupino’s own dark memories of polio as an aspiring teenage actress, as well as her use of documentary locations and nonprofessional actors—most tenderly in the famous wheelchair square dance filmed (by veteran John Ford cinematographer Archie Stout) with actual rehab patients at the Kabat-Kaiser Institute in Santa Monica."

Shot outside Pittsburgh on a shoestring budget, by a band of filmmakers determined to make their mark, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, directed by horror master George A. Romero, is a great story of independent cinema: a midnight hit turned box-office smash that became one of the most influential films of all time. A deceptively simple tale of a group of strangers trapped in a farmhouse who find themselves fending off a horde of recently dead, flesh-eating ghouls, Romero’s claustrophobic vision of a late-1960s America literally tearing itself apart rewrote the rules of the horror genre, combined gruesome gore with acute social commentary, and quietly broke ground by casting a black actor (Duane Jones) in its lead role. Stark, haunting, and more relevant than ever, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is back.

At a Siberian research center, Dmitriy works together with Ilya, and though Ilya&#39;s cynical manner is so different from his own, their disagreements do nothing to mar their friendship and mutual respect. As a new success is obtained, Dmitriy is again exposed to radiation. He persuades Ilya to keep the accident a secret until the experiments are completed. Lyolya, misunderstanding Dmitriy&#39;s remoteness, feels that she has failed as a wife. Dmitriy&#39;s health deteriorates, and, aware of his doom, he makes a visit to his family. At a Moscow clinic he asks doctors to perform an experimental bone marrow transplant with little chance of success. Ilya comes to visit him on the day before the operation and tells him that their experiments produced a new type of radiation which was not thermonuclear, as anticipated, but nonetheless would be an important contribution to science. As Ilya and Lyolya await the outcome of the operation at the hospital, they receive a note from Dmitriy promising a celebration."

Starring Naser Hashemi, Bakhtiyar Panjeei, Vahid Mobaser

One of the world’s great cinematic artists, Jafar Panahi has been carefully crafting self-reflexive works about artistic, personal, and political freedom for the past three decades, despite being banned from filmmaking by the Iranian government since 2010. In NO BEARS—completed shortly before his imprisonment in 2022—Panahi plays a fictionalized version of himself, a dissident filmmaker who relocates to a rural border town to direct a film remotely in nearby Turkey and finds himself embroiled in a local scandal. As he struggles to complete his film, Panahi must confront the opposing pulls of tradition and progress, city and country, belief and evidence, and the universal desire to reject oppression.

“Over a decade ago, in 2010, Jafar Panahi was sentenced to six years in prison and a twenty-year ban on directing films. He has, in the time since, directed five features; the unfathomable difficulty of this feat is as astonishing as how vital and how good his work continues to be. NO BEARS may be the best of them all.”
—Alison Willmore, “Vulture”

“Don’t miss NO BEARS . . . An act of profound resistance.” 
—Manohla Dargis, “The New York Times”

“A masterwork . . . Panahi once again uses his situation to produce something that’s somehow life-affirming and deeply devastating.” 
—David Fear, “Rolling Stone”

“Brilliant . . . Instantly gripping, formally ingenious.” 
—Justin Chang, “Los Angeles Times”

“Jafar Panahi may be the most vital and courageous filmmaker in the world right now.”

Shooting on his own as a one-man crew, Wenders gradually forges a friendship with Yamamoto, while reflecting on the relationships between clothes, identity, urban life, and creativity.

In 1964, author Samuel Beckett set out on one of the strangest ventures in cinematic history: his embattled collaboration with silent-era genius Buster Keaton on the production of a short, untitled avant-garde film. Beckett was nearing the peak of his fame, which would culminate in his receiving a Nobel Prize five years later. Keaton, in his waning years, would not live to see Beckett’s canonization. The film they made along with director Alan Schneider, renegade publisher Barney Rosset, and Academy Award–winning cinematographer Boris Kaufman has been the subject of praise, condemnation, and controversy for decades. Yet the eclectic participants are just one part of a story that stretches to the birth of cinema and encompasses our very understanding of human consciousness.

Their car packed to the gills, the punctilious Keith (Roger Sloman) and the more spontaneous Candice Marie (Alison Steadman) arrive at a Dorset campground for ten nights of idyllic bliss. It starts off pretty perfect: they go sightseeing, eat vegetarian food, and search for raw milk. Then a fellow with a loud radio pitches his tent near theirs. Things get worse when a couple arrive on a motorcycle, have noisy sex in their tent, and start an illegal campfire. Will Keith and Candice Marie find a peaceful corner, or are they doomed to brawl with the noisy and unwashed?"

Nearly twenty years after his wife’s tragic death, a guilt-ridden man (Cliff Robertson) meets her exact look-alike (Geneviève Bujold)—cue an obsessive makeover and an intricate series of double crosses. Sound familiar?

The first film director Edward Dmytryk made in England after being blacklisted from Hollywood is a wittily inventive blend of black comedy and suspense in which the investigation by a Scotland Yard detective (Naunton Wayne) into a London psychiatrist (Robert Newton) and his diabolical revenge against his adulterous wife’s lover becomes a most entertaining battle of wits. Making vivid use of the rubble-strewn landscapes of bombed-out postwar England, OBSESSION toys playfully with the well-worn genre convention of the “perfect crime.”"

Injured and hunted by the police, he seeks refuge throughout the city, while the woman he loves (Kathleen Ryan) searches for him among the shadows.

Pier Paolo Pasolini’s powerfully iconoclastic take on Sophocles’s tragedy blends eras and cultures to create a searing exploration of fate, free will, and the things we fear most in ourselves. Shot amid the stark, elemental landscapes of the Moroccan desert, and set in an indefinable ancient past, this bold reimagining casts the filmmaker’s frequent collaborator Franco Citti as the eponymous foundling, whose willful blindness to his own nature unleashes a cataclysmic reckoning. With a prologue and epilogue set in twentieth-century Italy, Pasolini connects the story to his own upbringing, daring to bare his soul on-screen."

Geraldine Chaplin delivers an arresting performance as an actor playing a victim of torture in a play based in part on the 1976 Argentine coup d’état, who becomes romantically involved with the show’s director Luis (José Luis Gómez).

As expectant father Mark (Daniel London) and nomadic Kurt (Will Oldham) travel by car and foot into the woods in search of some secluded hot springs, their fumbling attempts to reconnect keep butting up against the limits of their friendship and the reality of how much their paths have diverged since their shared youth. Adapted from a short story by Jonathan Raymond and accompanied by an atmospheric Yo La Tengo score, OLD JOY is a contemplative, wryly observed triumph whose modest scale belies the richness of its insight."

Jet Li returns in the sixth and final entry in the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA series, here under the direction of Sammo Hung, who transfers the action to the American Wild West for a rootin’ tootin’ cowboys-meet-kung fu mashup. This time around, our hero Wong Fei-hung (Li) heads to the States to visit the San Francisco branch of his traditional Chinese medicine clinic—only to find himself stricken with amnesia and embroiled in tensions between racist politicians and Chinese immigrants. Shot largely in Texas, ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA AND AMERICA cleverly reverses the conceit of the preceding entries by bringing Chinese culture to the West, while serving up the requisite smorgasbord of spectacular action-comedy set pieces."

Jet Li’s third outing as the storied martial-arts hero Wong Fei-hung is an exhilarating celebration of Chinese culture peppered with a dash of international espionage. This time around, Wong travels to Beijing, where he finds himself drawn into the intrigue surrounding an epic lion-dance competition, spars with a Russian rival for the affections of his beloved Thirteenth Aunt (Rosamund Kwan), and fights to foil a foreign plot to assassinate the real-life Chinese diplomat Li Hongzhang. The eye-popping lion-dance set pieces—which combine vibrantly colored, fire-breathing pageantry with martial-arts mayhem—rank among the most visually spectacular achievements of the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA series."

Leading audiences from New York recording studios to the awesome magic of Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago, the film spotlights artists across the twentieth century whose songs reflect regional and global themes that continue to resonate.

Starring Michel Piccoli, Marcello Mastroianni, Henri Garcin

A celebration of cinema’s centennial, ONE HUNDRED AND ONE NIGHTS finds Agnès Varda at her most playful. It is also perhaps her unlikeliest project: a star-studded comic fantasy with an extravagant sense of style and an adoring but slightly off-kilter perspective on the magic of filmmaking. French New Wave icon Michel Piccoli is a mysterious aging impresario named Simon Cinéma who has hired a young film student, Camille (Julie Gayet), to simply sit with him at his mansion and talk about movies. Skeptical yet increasingly enchanted, Camille bears witness to cinema itself coming to life, allowing Varda to wittily integrate a mind-boggling parade of appearances by screen legends (Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anouk Aimée, Robert De Niro, and many others), and attest to the vigorous health of the movies at the close of the twentieth century."

Paolo Sorrentino’s feature directorial debut finds him already exploring his signature themes of celebrity, masculinity, and moral corruption via an incisive dual portrait of two similarly named men who ascend to the heights of fame amid the sordid world of 1980s Naples. While Tony Pisapia (Toni Servillo) finds success as a singer of cheesy pop songs, Antonio Pisapia (Andrea Renzi) achieves glory on the soccer field—until drugs, scandal, and tragedy upend both their careers and force them to fight their way back into the spotlight."

In the early 1960s in Paris, two young women become friends. Pomme is an aspiring singer. Suzanne is a pregnant country girl unable to support a third child. Pomme lends Suzanne the money for an illegal abortion, but a sudden tragedy soon separates them. Ten years later, they reunite at a demonstration and pledge to keep in touch via postcard, as each of their lives is irrevocably changed by the women’s liberation movement. A buoyant hymn to sisterly solidarity rooted in the hard-won victories of a generation of women, ONE SINGS, THE OTHER DOESN’T is one of Agnès Varda’s warmest and most politically trenchant films, a feminist musical for the ages."

The only feature from the radical Afro-Cuban filmmaker Sara Gómez—who also worked as an assistant director with Agnès Varda and Tomás Gutiérrez Alea before her untimely death at age thirty-one—is an extraordinary portrait of postrevolution Cuba. Blending invaluable documentary footage with a loose narrative about the budding relationship between an outspoken schoolteacher (Yolanda Cuellar) and a young worker (Mario Balmaseda) facing a moral crisis, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER depicts revolution as an ongoing process that takes place at the level of community—among friends, lovers, coworkers, teachers, students, and parents, all of whom must work together to negotiate a new social order. Above all, Gómez offers a trenchant intersectional critique of the lingering sexism and machismo that, she argues, must be cleared away in order to create a truly just society."

Deep within the wind-swept marshes of war-torn medieval Japan, an impoverished mother and her daughter-in-law eke out a lonely, desperate existence. Forced to murder lost samurai and sell their belongings for grain, they dump the corpses down a deep, dark hole and live off their meager spoils. When a bedraggled neighbor returns from the skirmishes, lust, jealousy, and rage threaten to destroy the trio’s tenuous existence, before an ominous, ill-gotten demon mask seals the trio’s horrifying fate. Driven by primal emotions, dark eroticism, a frenzied score by Hikaru Hayashi, and stunning images both lyrical and macabre, Kaneto Shindo’s chilling folktale ONIBABA is a singular cinematic experience."

There she meets a handsome and aloof daredevil pilot, played by Cary Grant, who runs an airmail company, staring down death while servicing towns in treacherous mountain terrain. Both attracted to and repelled by his romantic sense of danger, she decides to stay on, despite his protestations.

As torrents of rain envelop the town, Ma Zhe will be drawn to the edge of madness in pursuit of truth.

In turn-of-the-twentieth-century Turin, an accident in a textile factory incites workers to stage a walkout. But it’s not until they receive unexpected aid from a traveling professor (Marcello Mastroianni) that they find their voice, unite, and stand up for themselves. This historical drama by Mario Monicelli, brimming with humor and honesty, is a beautiful and moving ode to the power of the people, and features engaging, naturalistic performances; cinematography by the great Giuseppe Rotunno; and a multilayered, Oscar-nominated screenplay by Monicelli, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli."

This legendary, long-unavailable documentary from Direct Cinema pioneer D. A. Pennebaker captures the behind-the-scenes drama that went into the making of a classic Broadway recording. When Stephen Sondheim’s groundbreaking concept musical “Company” opened on Broadway in 1970, it was an immediate triumph. Shortly thereafter, the actors, musicians, and Sondheim assembled to record the original cast album in a grueling, nearly nineteen-hour session that tested the talents of all involved—including Elaine Stritch, who pushed herself to the limit to record what would become her iconic version of “The Ladies Who Lunch.” With raw immediacy, Pennebaker and his crew document the explosive energy and creative intensity that go into capturing the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of live performance."

Starring Oscar-Roza Miller, Yanis Sahraoui, Liz Christin

“Come, come! I’m sick to death of this particular self. I want another.” Taking Virginia Woolf’s novel “Orlando: A Biography” as his starting point, academic virtuoso turned filmmaker Paul B. Preciado fashioned the documentary ORLANDO, MY POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY—a personal essay, historical analysis, and social manifesto. For almost a century, Woolf’s eponymous hero(ine) has inspired readers with their gender fluidity as well as their physical and spiritual metamorphoses across a three-hundred-year span. In making his film, Preciado invited a diverse group of more than twenty trans and nonbinary people to play the role of Orlando and to participate in this shared biography. Together, they perform interpretations of the novel, weaving into Woolf’s narrative their own stories of transition and identity formation. Not content to simply update a groundbreaking work, Preciado interrogates the relevance of “Orlando” in the ongoing struggle to secure dignity for trans people worldwide."

Gloriously cinematic despite its tiny budget, Orson Welles’s OTHELLO is a testament to the filmmaker’s stubborn willingness to pursue his vision to the ends of the earth. Unmatched in his passionate identification with Shakespeare’s imagination, Welles brings his inventive visual approach to this enduring tragedy of jealousy, bigotry, and rage, and also gives a towering performance as the Moor of Venice, alongside Suzanne Cloutier as the innocent Desdemona, and Micheál MacLiammóir as the scheming Iago. Shot over the course of three years in Italy and Morocco and plagued by many logistical problems, this fiercely independent film joins MACBETH and CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT in making the case for Welles as the cinema’s most audacious interpreter of the Bard."

Directed by Aki Kaurismäki • 2017 • Finland

This wry, melancholic comedy from Aki Kaurismäki, a response to the ongoing global refugee crisis, follows two people searching for a place to call home. Khaled (Sherwan Haji), a displaced Syrian, lands in Helsinki as a stowaway; meanwhile, middle-aged Finnish salesman Wikström (Sakari Kuosmanen) leaves his wife and his job and buys a conspicuously unprofitable restaurant. Khaled is denied asylum but decides not to return to Aleppo, and the paths of the two men cross fortuitously. As deadpan as the best of the director&#39;s work, and with a deep well of empathy for its down-but-not-out characters (many of them played by members of Kaurismäki&#39;s loyal stock company), THE OTHER SIDE OF HOPE is a bittersweet celebration of pockets of human kindness in an unwelcoming world."

A remote manor; hushed, candlelit atmosphere; and shivery, supernatural menace. With his first English-language feature, Chilean Spanish writer-director-composer Alejandro Amenábar resurrected the classic gothic chiller to create a ghost story of uncommon emotional resonance. Nicole Kidman stars as a World War II–era mother whose imperiousness masks a terrifying pain, as she keeps her light-sensitive children enshrouded in darkness on her country estate. The arrival of three new servants punctures her insular world—and seems to disturb the balance between the living and the dead.

Charged with an almost demonic intensity, this electrifying thriller unfolds in the borderlands of western Ukraine (just prior to the Russian invasion) where former smuggler Pamfir (Oleksandr Yatsentiuk) returns home on the eve of the traditional Malanka festival. He’s determined to start a new, honest life for the sake of his family—but his son’s transgression soon pulls him back into the criminal underworld and sets him on a perilous path with irreversible consequences.

Sensationally modern, the film follows the downward spiral of the fiery, brash, yet innocent showgirl Lulu, whose sexual vivacity has a devastating effect on everyone she comes in contact with.

Proud, eccentric, and antisocial, Monsieur Hire (Michel Simon) has always kept to himself. But after a woman turns up dead in the Paris suburb where he lives, he feels drawn to a pretty young newcomer to town (Viviane Romance), discovers that his neighbors are only too ready to suspect the worst of him, and is framed for the murder. Based on a novel by Georges Simenon, Julien Duvivier’s first film after his return to France from Hollywood finds the acclaimed poetic realist applying his consummate craft to darker, moodier ends. Propelled by its two deeply nuanced lead performances, the tensely noirish PANIQUE exposes the dangers of the knives-out mob mentality, delivering as well a pointed allegory for the behavior of Duvivier’s countrymen during the war."

The Nazi persecution of homosexuals may be one of the least-told stories of the Third Reich. Directed by Oscar winners Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, PARAGRAPH 175 fills a crucial gap in the historical record, and reveals the lasting consequences of this hidden chapter of twentieth-century history. These are stories of survivors—sometimes bitter, but just as often filled with irony and humor; tortured by their memories, yet infused with a powerful will to endure. Their moving testimonies, rendered with evocative images of their lives and times, tell a haunting, compelling story of human resistance.

One of the original critics turned filmmakers who helped jump-start the French New Wave, Jacques Rivette began shooting his debut feature in 1958, well before that cinema revolution officially kicked off with THE 400 BLOWS and BREATHLESS. Ultimately released in 1961, the rich and mysterious PARIS BELONGS TO US offers some of the radical flavor that would define the movement, with a particularly Rivettian twist. The film follows a young literature student (Betty Schneider) who befriends the members of a loose-knit group of twentysomethings in Paris, united by the apparent suicide of an acquaintance. Suffused with a lingering post-World War II disillusionment while also evincing the playfulness and fascination with theatrical performance and conspiracy that would become hallmarks for the director, PARIS BELONGS TO US marked the provocative start to a brilliant directorial career."

Years before they became major players in Hollywood, a group of young German filmmakers, including eventual noir masters Robert Siodmak and Edgar G.

This effervescent, sunlit silent, about a handful of city dwellers (a charming cast of nonprofessionals) enjoying a weekend outing, offers a rare glimpse of Weimar-era Berlin.

On the lam in the labyrinthine Casbah of Algiers, Pépé is safe from the clutches of the police—until a Parisian playgirl compels him to risk his life and leave its confines once and for all. One of the most influential films of the 20th century and a landmark of French poetic realism, Julien Duvivier’s PÉPÉ LE MOKO is presented here in its full-length version."

Before his convention-shattering debut, BREATHLESS, had even premiered, Jean-Luc Godard leapt into the making of his second feature, a thriller that would tackle the most controversial subject in France: the use of torture in the Algerian War. Despite his lack of political convictions, photojournalist Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor) is roped into a paramilitary group waging a shadow war in Geneva against the Algerian independence movement. Anna Karina (in her first collaboration with Godard, whose camera is visibly besotted with her) is beguiling as the mysterious woman with whom Forestier becomes infatuated. Banned for two and a half years by French censors for its depiction of brutal tactics on the part of the French government and the Algerian fighters alike, LE PETIT SOLDAT finds the young Godard already retooling cinema as a vehicle for existential inquiry, political argument, and ephemeral portraiture—in other words, as a medium for delivering “truth twenty-four times per second.”"

Haneke finds his match in Isabelle Huppert, who delivers an icy but quietly seething performance as Erika, a piano professor at a Viennese conservatory who lives with her mother in a claustrophobically codepen­dent relation­ship.

A critical breakthrough for Haneke, THE PIANO TEACHER—which won the Grand Prix as well as dual acting awards for its stars at Cannes—is a formalist masterwork that remains a shocking sensation."

After many years of supporting roles in Hollywood, Anna May Wong left for Europe in search of better work—and with this stylish silent masterpiece from E. A. Dupont (VARIETÉ) she found what is widely regarded as her greatest role. She is mesmerizing as Shosho, the Chinese scullery maid at a Piccadilly nightclub who overnight becomes the toast of London—and the object of desire of all around her. The camera adores Wong, and against Alfred Junge’s astonishing set design, she glows on the big screen."

As his compulsive pursuit of the thrill of stealing grows, however, so does his fear that his luck is about to run out. A cornerstone of the career of this most economical and profoundly spiritual of filmmakers, PICKPOCKET is an elegantly crafted, tautly choreographed study of humanity in all its mischief and grace, the work of a director at the height of his powers."

This sensual and striking chronicle of a disappearance and its aftermath put director Peter Weir on the map and helped usher in a new era of Australian cinema. Based on an acclaimed 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK is set at the turn of the twentieth century and concerns a small group of students from an all-female college who vanish, along with a chaperone, while on a St. Valentine’s Day outing. Less a mystery than a journey into the mystic, as well as an inquiry into issues of class and sexual repression in Australian society, Weir’s gorgeous, disquieting film is a work of poetic horror whose secrets haunt viewers to this day."

Paeans to dreams and progress, these temples of cinema have also come to reflect major shifts in Brazilian society and politics. Combining archival documentary, mystery, film clips, and personal memories, PICTURES OF GHOSTS is a map of a city through the lens of cinema, offering a delightful tour in the company of a master storyteller."

Yet this is no normal road trip: genius auteur Jean-Luc Godard’s tenth feature in six years is a stylish mash-up of anticonsumerist satire, au courant politics, and comic-book aesthetics, as well as a violent, zigzag tale of, as Godard called them, “the last romantic couple.” With blissful color imagery by cinematographer Raoul Coutard and Belmondo and Karina at their most animated, PIERROT LE FOU (“Crazy Pierrot”) is one of the high points of the French New Wave, and was Godard’s last frolic before he moved ever further into radical cinema."

The documentary captures in unflinching detail—and in beautifully unpolished black-and-white cinematography—the procedural killing, dismembering, and processing of the animal, resulting in a depiction of both the physical gruesomeness and artisanal craft of such work.

A treasure of American independent filmmaking that was neglected for decades until its triumphant rediscovery, writer-director-producer Michael Roemer’s feature follow-up to his landmark NOTHING BUT A MAN is a wryly observed, delectably deadpan comedy set in the world of New York’s Jewish community and the small-time mobsters operating within it. After two decades behind bars, low-level racketeer Harry Plotnick (memorably cow-eyed Martin Priest) is released into a changed city he hardly recognizes.

Made up of mesmerizing scenes of Russell and his band performing, both in concert and in the studio, as well as off-the-cuff moments behind the scenes, this singular film - which also features performances by Willie Nelson and George Jones - has attained legendary status over the years.

Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival, POISON went on to become one of the most controversial and celebrated films of the decade, attacked by right-wing demagogues and heralded as a landmark of the emerging New Queer Cinema movement."

With Guitry’s witty dialogue and fleet pacing, this black comedy is the quintessential depiction of a marriage gone sour: after thirty years together, a village gardener (Simon) and his wife (Germaine Reuver) find themselves contemplating how to do away with each other, with the former even planning how he’ll negotiate his eventual criminal trial. Inspired by Guitry’s own post–World War II tangle with the law—a wrongful charge of collaborationism—LA POISON is a blithely caustic broadside against the French legal system and a society all too eager to capitalize on the misfortunes of others."

But it isn’t long before he’s back in action, racing the clock to stop a band of serial bombers and win back his much-put-upon girlfriend May (the phenomenal Maggie Cheung, reprising her star-making role). Boasting epic explosions, an awesomely 1980s electro soundtrack, and a showstopping finale—which turns an abandoned warehouse into a life-size pinball machine of cascading oil drums, collapsing scaffolds, and shooting fireworks—POLICE STORY 2 confirmed Chan’s status as a performer of unparalleled grace and daring."

“I killed my father. I ate human flesh.

In one story, a defiant man (Pierre Clémenti) perpetrates increasingly barbaric acts while wandering a mythic, volcanic landscape. In the other, the scion (Jean-Pierre Léaud) of a wealthy, ex-Nazi industrial family conceals a shocking proclivity.

From time to time, Haru shares her bed with Subu, though she believes her dead husband, reincarnated as a carp, disapproves. Director Shohei Imamura has always delighted in the kinky exploits of lowlifes, and in this 1966 classic, he finds subversive humor in the bizarre dynamics of Haru, her Oedipal son, and her daughter, the true object of her pornographer-boyfriend’s obsession.

It’s there that Jean Diego (Yves Montand in one of his first film roles), a former member of the French underground Resistance, has an encounter with destiny as he meets a long-lost comrade, villains of the war, a prophetic tramp, and a beautiful woman who will draw him into an inexorable tragedy. A richly allegorical evocation of a country reckoning with the guilt and national trauma of World War II and the occupation, LES PORTES DE LA NUIT (“The Gates of the Night”) was a tough sell for postwar audiences looking for escapism, but it can now be appreciated for both its haunting atmosphere and unique fusion of poetic fantasy and bitter reality."

Philbert (Gary Farmer), his easygoing friend, pursues Native wisdom and lore wherever he can find it—even on “Bonanza.” As the two set off on a journey to bail out Buddy’s imprisoned sister, Philbert’s gentle faith challenges Buddy’s hard-edged view of the world, and together they face the realities and dreams of being Cheyenne in the modern-day U.S."

A strikingly shot work of documentary as historical corrective, John Hanson and Rob Nilsson’s PRAIRIE TRILOGY chronicles the story of early North Dakota socialists through a portrait of Henry Martinson, a ninety-seven-year-old ex-organizer and poet. In PRAIRIE FIRE, Martinson recounts the 1916 birth of the Socialist Nonpartisan League, his narrative accompanied by images shot by Nilsson’s own grandfather, Frithjof Holmboe."

Starring Lukás Bech, Antonín Vanha, Eva Kacírková

One of the unsung masterpieces of Věra Chytilová’s still largely obscure post-sixties career, this stingingly satiric yet deeply human tragicomedy surveys the everyday absurdity of existence in a ramshackle, perpetually under-construction prefab housing complex: a monument to Soviet idealism that, in its forlorn shoddiness, becomes a symbol of its failings. Blending slapsticks gags with a jagged vérité visual style, Chytilová fashions a devastatingly funny portrait of life in a (literally) crumbling society."

Starring Herbert Norville, Oscar James, Frank Singuineau

The fiction debut by esteemed Trinidadian-British documentarian Horace Ové marked a watershed in the history of British cinema. This gripping and immersive drama was the nation’s first feature to be written and directed by a Black filmmaker, and the first to fully focus on the perspective of Black characters. Ové and novelist Sam Selvon’s gritty script centers on teenage Tony (Herbert Norville), caught between his Trinidadian parents’ (Lucita Lijertwood and Frank Singuineau) desire to attain middle-class respectability in London and his older brother Colin’s (Oscar James) urging to join the Black Power movement. After encountering racism while hanging out with a white girl and searching for employment, Tony finds comradeship with a group of aimless Caribbean boys, only to discover that their petty criminality is a dead end. Ové depicts Tony’s subsequent political awakening in captivating vérité style as he realizes that taking on the system will invite not only violent police oppression but also a thorough examination of his own values and beliefs. Suffused with the political outrage and explosive rebellion of 1970s London, PRESSURE is a marvel of lived-in independent filmmaking that captures Black working-class solidarity while refusing easy solutions to social problems—like income disparity, juvenile delinquency, racial profiling—that remain relevant today."

Told almost entirely through voice-over narration by Gallic luminaries Mathieu Amalric, Françoise Lebrun, and Grégory Gadebois, A PRINCE follows the journey of a young man (Antoine Pirotte) as he begins an apprenticeship in the French countryside to train as a gardener.

Staking out territory on the cold winter streets of midtown Manhattan, West African immigrant Lucky (Prince Adu) uses the gift of gab and a hustler’s shrewdness to peddle designer knockoffs for Lebanese store owner Levon (Karren Karagulian). One day, a long-forgotten ex named Linda (Kat Sanchez) delivers shocking news: years ago she had Lucky’s baby (Aiden Noesi) and now needs him to tend the toddler for several weeks—though Lucky suspects she’s using him to completely abdicate her parental responsibilities. Now Lucky must figure out how to become a father overnight without losing his girlfriend, Karina (Keyali Mayaga), or his edge in the counterfeit-merch game. Directed, photographed, edited, coproduced, and cowritten by Sean Baker, PRINCE OF BROADWAY scintillates with the live-wire energy of its mostly nonprofessional cast and the authenticity of its documentarylike production, shot on location in New York City.

Desperate men are entrapped into indentured labor on a yerba maté plantation under the brutal foreman Köhner—a situation made tenser by the fact that both Köhner and a worker named Podeley love Andrea, the sweet-spirited daughter of the camp’s doctor, and that eventually boils over into an explosive rebellion led by Podeley.

Sing along with the common people in this exuberant, appropriately offbeat tribute to the charmingly cheeky Britpop legends. Though culminating with the farewell concert the band played to thousands of adoring fans in their hometown of Sheffield, England, PULP: A FILM ABOUT LIFE, DEATH &amp;amp; SUPERMARKETS is by no means a traditional concert film or rock doc. As much a testament to the band as it is to the city and inhabitants of Sheffield, the film weaves exclusive concert footage with man-on-the-street interviews and dreamy staged sequences to paint a picture much larger, funnier, and more life-affirming than any music film of recent memory."

Kathleen Hanna, electrifying lead singer of the punk band Bikini Kill and dance-punk trio Le Tigre, rose to national attention as the reluctant but never shy voice of the riot grrrl movement, becoming both a famously outspoken feminist leader as well as a cultural lightning rod. While her critics wished she would just shut up, her fans hoped she never would. So in 2005, when Hanna stopped shouting, many wondered why. Through twenty years of archival footage and revealing interviews with Hanna, THE PUNK SINGER offers a never-before-seen view into the life of this fearless artist."

Alain Delon was at his most impossibly beautiful when PURPLE NOON was released and made him an instant star. This ripe, colorful adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s vicious novel “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” directed by the versatile René Clément, stars Delon as Tom Ripley, a duplicitous American charmer in Rome on a mission to bring his privileged, devil-may-care acquaintance Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) back to the United States. What initially seems a carefree tale of friendship soon morphs into a thrilling saga of seduction, identity theft, and murder. Featuring gorgeous location photography of coastal Italy, PURPLE NOON is crafted with a light touch that allows it to be at once suspenseful and erotic, and it gave Delon the role of a lifetime."

Starring Phil Daniels, Leslie Ash, Sting

The Who’s classic rock opera “Quadrophenia” was the basis for this invigorating coming-of-age movie and depiction of the defiant, drug-fueled mod subculture of early-1960s London. Our antihero is Jimmy (Phil Daniels), a teenager dissatisfied with family, work, and love. He spends his time knocking around with his clothes-obsessed, pill-popping, scooter-driving fellow mods, a group whose antipathy for the motorcycle-riding rockers leads to a climactic riot in Brighton. Director Franc Roddam’s rough-edged film is a quintessential chronicle of youthful rebellion and turmoil, with Pete Townshend’s brilliant songs (including “I’ve Had Enough,” “5:15,” and “Love Reign O’er Me”) providing emotional support, and featuring Sting and Ray Winstone in early roles."

Soon the femme fatale introduces him to a pair of thieves (Thomy Bourdelle and Raymond Aimos), who plan to rob the local bar where Anna now works, forcing Jean to decide whether to take part in a big score or to protect his former belle. An effusive love letter to Paris—recreated by the legendary art director Lazare Meerson, in some of the early sound era’s most extraordinary sets—QUATORZE JUILLET (“July Fourteenth”) showcases director René Clair’s preternatural ability to balance drama, romance, and comedy, applying a light touch to the profoundest of sentiments."

QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE: ALIVE IN THE CATACOMBS is the cinematic realization of a dream years in the making, an audiovisual document of the band’s long-rumored performance in the tunnels of the famed Catacombs of Paris. Recorded in July 2024, the film captures the alternative-rock legends as you’ve never seen or heard them before, with each song carefully chosen and reimagined to reflect the darkly atmospheric ambience and natural resonances of the Catacombs. The result is an unprecedented incarnation of Queens of the Stone Age at their most intimate, yet surrounded by literally millions of human remains—“the biggest audience we’ve ever played for,” says frontman Josh Homme.

Conjured from the unholy meeting of two iconoclastic queer artists, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s final film audaciously raises Jean Genet’s controversial novel to the level of myth. In an expressionistic soundstage vision of a French seaport town—bathed in fiery hues and complete with phallic spires—a strapping sailor and unrepentant criminal (Brad Davis) comes ashore to arouse passion, rivalry, and violence among the libidinal denizens drawn into his orbit. Enacted with dreamlike stylization by a cast of international stars, including Jeanne Moreau and Franco Nero, QUERELLE finds Fassbinder pushing his taboo-shattering depiction of gay desire to delirious extremes."

In adapting her own novel, Breillat unflinchingly depicts the dark desires of Alice (Charlotte Alexandra), a rural adolescent whose uninhibited sexual experimentation troubles her parents (Rita Maiden and Bruno Balp) and augurs doom for her first lover (Hiram Keller). Originally withheld from theaters due to censorship concerns, GIRL proved itself to be not only ahead of its time but also an audacious trial run for Breillat’s core strategies and themes, including the connection between transgressive fantasy and sober reality."

Yasujiro Ozu’s first post–World War II film takes place in an impoverished Tokyo neighborhood that has been partly destroyed in bombing raids. Here, a hard-hearted middle-aged widow (Choko Iida) reluctantly takes in a child (Hohi Aoki) abandoned by his father. Bitter at first, she soon finds herself growing fond of the boy. Ozu’s delicate, humorous, and unsentimental story of redemption is the director’s expression of a country slowly coming out of the dark."

Rarely has the spirit of childhood been evoked as exquisitely as in this Academy Award–winning cinematic fable, a fantasy with the texture of reality. On the streets of 1950s Paris, a young boy (played by director Albert Lamorisse’s son, Pascal) is launched on a miraculous adventure when he’s playfully pursued by a shiny red balloon that seems to have a mind of its own—until the harsh realities of the world interfere, setting the stage for a deeply moving finale. Shot in beautifully muted Technicolor, this beguiling allegory of innocence and transcendence has inspired generations of viewers to let their imaginations take flight."

A testament to the goodness of humankind, Akira Kurosawa’s RED BEARD (AKAHIGE) chronicles the tumultuous relationship between an arrogant young doctor and a compassionate clinic director. Toshiro Mifune, in his last role for Kurosawa, gives a powerhouse performance as the dignified yet empathic director who guides his pupil to maturity, teaching the embittered intern to appreciate the lives of his destitute patients. Perfectly capturing the look and feel of 19th-century Japan, Kurosawa weaves a fascinating tapestry of time, place, and emotion."

Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1960s panoramas of contemporary alienation were decade-defining artistic events, and RED DESERT, his first color film, is perhaps his most epochal. This provocative look at the spiritual desolation of the technological age—about a disaffected woman, brilliantly portrayed by Antonioni muse Monica Vitti, wandering through a bleak industrial landscape beset by power plants and environmental toxins, and tentatively flirting with her husband’s coworker, played by Richard Harris—continues to keep viewers spellbound. With one startling, painterly composition after another—of abandoned fishing cottages, electrical towers, looming docked ships—RED DESERT creates a nearly apocalyptic image of its time, and confirms Antonioni as cinema’s preeminent poet of the modern age."

Early in his career, the Austrian-born future Oscar winner Fred Zinnemann codirected with Emilio Gómez Muriel the politically and emotionally searing REDES. In this vivid, documentary-like dramatization of the daily grind of men struggling to make a living by fishing on the Gulf of Mexico (mostly played by real-life fishermen), one worker’s terrible loss instigates a political awakening among him and his fellow laborers. A singular coming together of talents, REDES, commissioned by a progressive Mexican government, was cowritten and gorgeously shot by the legendary photographer Paul Strand.

Starring John Wayne, Montgomery Clift, Walter Brennan

No matter what genre he worked in, Howard Hawks played by his own rules, and never was this more evident than in his first western, the rowdy and whip-smart RED RIVER. In it, John Wayne found one of his greatest roles, as an embittered, tyrannical Texas rancher whose tensions with his independent-minded adopted son—played by Montgomery Clift, in a breakout performance—reach epic proportions during a cattle drive to Missouri. The film is based on a novel that dramatizes the real-life late nineteenth-century expeditions along the Chisholm Trail, but Hawks is less interested in historical accuracy than in tweaking the codes of masculinity that propel the myths of the American West. The unerringly macho Wayne and the neurotic, boyish Clift make for an improbably perfect pair, held aloft by a quick-witted, multilayered screenplay and Hawks’s formidable direction."

Moira Shearer is a rising star ballerina torn between an idealistic composer and a ruthless impresario intent on perfection.

A multilayered, self-reflexive portrait of a 1970s New York City feminist collective, the film charts the rifts that form within the group and between its members and the filmmaker—a breakdown that is reflected in the film’s radical splintering of sound and image. Shelved for decades due to the objections of its subjects, REGROUPING—exhibited now with the permission of its participants—reemerges as an essential chronicle of the second-wave women’s movement and of the meaning, possibilities, and pitfalls of collective action.

When André meets temptation in the form of the alluring Catherine (Michèle Morgan) during a risky rescue, he comes perilously close to betraying his wife of ten years.

While on a tour through Germany, Belgium, and France to promote her latest movie, Anna (Aurore Clément), an accomplished filmmaker, passes through a series of eerie, exquisitely shot brief encounters—with men and women, family and strangers—that gradually reveal her emotional and physical detachment from the world.

Starring Johannes Krisch, Irina Potapenko, Ursula Strauss

A gripping thriller and a tragic drama of nearly Greek proportions, REVANCHE is the stunning, Oscar-nominated international breakthrough of Austrian filmmaker Götz Spielmann. In a ragged section of Vienna, hardened ex-con Alex (the mesmerizing Johannes Krisch) works in a brothel, where he falls for Ukrainian hooker Tamara. Their desperate plans for escape unexpectedly intersect with the lives of a rural cop and his seemingly content wife. With meticulous, elegant direction, Spielmann creates a tense, existential, and surprising portrait of vengeance and redemption, and a journey into the darkest forest of human nature, in which violence and beauty exist side by side."

A child is raised in Korea to avenge the death of his father’s first child in this decades-spanning tale of obsession and violence, the third collaboration between director Ermek Shinarbaev and writer Anatoli Kim. A study of everyday evil infused with philosophy and poetry, this haunting allegory was the first Soviet film to look at the Korean diaspora in central Asia, and a founding work of the Kazakh New Wave. Rigorous and complex, REVENGE weaves luminous imagery with inventive narrative elements in an unforgettable meditation on the way trauma is passed down through generations.

Jealousy mounts, blood is shed, and a striving family faces self-destruction in this incisive, sensuous, emotionally bruising masterwork from director Luchino Visconti. With an operatic Nino Rota score and Giuseppe Rotunno’s glimmering, on-location cinematography, ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS “represents the artistic apotheosis of Italian neorealism,” says A.O.

“Is cinema a language about to get lost, an art about to die?” At the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, Wim Wenders invited fifteen other filmmakers to give their personal answers to that question. Their responses—recorded privately via a static camera inside a hotel room—form an enlightening, provocative, and philosophical reflection on the challenges then facing filmmakers and on the possible future of their industry. Featuring luminaries such as Jean-Luc Godard, Werner Herzog, Steven Spielberg, Michelangelo Antonioni, Susan Seidelman, Yılmaz Güney, and, in his last interview before his death just weeks later, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, ROOM 666 offers a uniquely candid look at the relationship between artists and their craft."

Utilizing the same minimalist, fixed camera format as Wenders, Playoust invites thirty directors who attended the 2022 festival—including Claire Denis, David Cronenberg, Lynne Ramsay, Asghar Farhadi, James Gray, and Wenders himself—to give their unfiltered perspectives on the state of the industry. Touching on upheavals in the technology, distribution, and economics of filmmaking as well as on larger questions of politics and culture, their answers provide a thought-provoking exploration of the meaning and relevance of cinema in the twenty-first century."

Merchant Ivory Productions, led by director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant, became a household name with A ROOM WITH A VIEW, the first of their extraordinary adaptations of E. M. Forster novels. A cherubic nineteen-year-old Helena Bonham Carter plays Lucy Honeychurch, a young, independent-minded, upper-class Edwardian woman who is trying to sort out her burgeoning romantic feelings, divided between an enigmatic free spirit (Julian Sands) she meets on vacation in Florence and the priggish bookworm (Daniel Day-Lewis) to whom she becomes engaged back in the more corseted Surrey.

ROSA LUXEMBURG is Margarethe von Trotta’s remarkable look at one of the most fascinating figures in modern European political history. Having fought for women’s rights in early-twentieth-century Poland and Germany, the Marxist revolutionary Luxemburg formed the famous Spartacist League, later the Communist Party of Germany, before being assassinated at age forty-seven. Built around an extraordinary performance from Barbara Sukowa (winner of the best actress award at Cannes), this multilayered portrait traces Luxemburg’s political and moral development from journalist and author to dissenter from the party line and imprisoned pacifist, bringing her character alive on-screen with depth and complexity."

It’s a swift and simple tale made revelatory by the raw, empathetic way in which the directors render Rosetta’s desperation, keeping the camera nearly perched on her shoulder throughout. Many have copied the Dardennes’ style, but few have equaled it.

Cantopop superstars Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung display the androgynous magnetism that made them icons as doomed lovers in this emblematic film of Hong Kong’s Second New Wave, directed by pioneering queer melodrama master Stanley Kwan. ROUGE bridges past and present in its tragic romance between a humble courtesan and the wayward scion of a wealthy family, who embrace death by suicide pact amid the opulent teahouses of 1930s Hong Kong. Fifty years later, she returns to the city-state to find him, drawing a young contemporary couple (Alex Man and Emily Chu) into her quest to rekindle a passion that may be as illusory as time itself.

A celebration of an artist’s life in the purest sense, RYUICHI SAKAMOTO | OPUS is the swan song of one of the world’s greatest musicians. As a parting gift, in late 2022, Ryuichi Sakamoto mustered all of his energy to leave us with one final performance: a concert film featuring just him and his piano. Curated and sequenced by Sakamoto himself, the twenty pieces of his played in the film wordlessly tell the story of his life and his wide-ranging oeuvre. The selection spans his entire career, from his pop-star period with Yellow Magic Orchestra and his magnificent scores for filmmakers Bernardo Bertolucci and Nagisa Oshima to his meditative final album, “12.” Intimately filmed in black and white, and surrounded by trusted collaborators—including director Neo Sora, his son—Sakamoto bares his soul through his exquisitely haunting melodies, knowing this was the last time he would be able to present his art.

Legendary director Nobuhiko Obayashi brings his unique vision to the notorious true story of Sada Abe, the Japanese geisha whose life of hardship and sadomasochistic obsession exploded into public scandal in 1936 when she strangled her lover and cut off his genitalia as a keepsake. While the same incident famously inspired Nagisa Oshima’s controversial IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES, Obayashi’s typically offbeat, visually remarkable telling of the story differs greatly, focusing on the title character’s backstory and adopting an often darkly humorous tone."

Posing profound moral questions about the relationship between art, politics, and resistance, this heady, richly detailed historical drama unfolds during the Nazi occupation of France as two filmmakers (based on real-life figures) attempt to navigate their careers without compromising their ideals. Facing pressure from the Vichy government, assistant director Jean Devaivre (Jacques Gamblin) uses his position at the German-controlled studio Continental Films as a cover for his resistance activities, while screenwriter Jean Aurenche (Denis Podalydès) uses his wits to keep from being involved in the creation of any collaborationist propaganda."

The comic genius of silent star Harold Lloyd is eternal. Chaplin is the sweet innocent, Keaton the stoic outsider, but Lloyd—the modern guy striving for success—is us. And with its torrent of perfectly executed gags and astonishing stunts, SAFETY LAST! is the perfect introduction to him. Lloyd plays a small-town bumpkin trying to make it in the big city, who finds employment as a lowly department-store clerk. He comes up with a wild publicity stunt to draw attention to the store, resulting in an incredible feat of derring-do on his part that gets him started on the climb to success. Laugh-out-loud funny and jaw-dropping in equal measure, SAFETY LAST! is a movie experience par excellence, anchored by a genuine legend."

Here, our bespectacled hero plays a wealthy, idle playboy who, in order to prove his worth to the father of the girl he hopes to marry, joins the Navy.

Conceived as an ode to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, this titanic super spectacle, set in the twelfth-century Crusades, is Egyptian cinema’s rebuttal to the Hollywood Christian epic. Ahmed Mazhar—a military-academy classmate of Nasser’s—stars as Saladin, the ruler of the kingdoms surrounding Jerusalem. When Christian invaders slaughter a band of Muslim pilgrims, Saladin sets out to take back the holy land against all odds. Working with an unprecedented budget (so big, in fact, that it bankrupted the producer) and a cast of thousands, director Youssef Chahine’s most large-scale work is a rousing vision of pan-Arab unity realized with the director’s trademark visual dynamism."

This radically influential portrait of American dreams and disillusionment from Direct Cinema pioneers David Maysles, Albert Maysles, and Charlotte Zwerin captures, with indelible humanity, the worlds of four dogged door-to-door Bible salesmen as they travel from Boston to Florida on a seemingly futile quest to sell luxury editions of the Good Book to working-class Catholics. A vivid evocation of midcentury malaise that unfolds against a backdrop of cheap motels, smoky diners, and suburban living rooms, SALESMAN assumes poignant dimensions as it uncovers the way its subjects’ fast-talking bravado masks frustration, disappointment, and despair. Revolutionizing the art of nonfiction storytelling with its nonjudgmental, observational style, this landmark documentary is one of the most penetrating films ever made about how deeply embedded consumerism is in America’s sense of its own values."

Filming in the exact locations and enlisting a cast of native Sicilians once impacted by the real Giuliano, director Francesco Rosi harnessed the facts and myths surrounding the true story of the bandit’s death to create a startling exposé of Sicily and the tangled relations between its citizens, the Mafia, and government officials.

DUEL AT ICHIJOJI TEMPLE furthers Miyamoto along his path to spiritual enlightenment, as well as further from the arms of the two women who love him: loyal Otsu (Kaoru Yachigusa) and conniving yet tragic Akemi (Mariko Okada). The film also brings him face to face with hordes of rivals intent on cutting him down, especially his legendary rival Kojiro (Koji Tsuruta).

Twists of fate, however, turn him into a fugitive. But he is saved by a woman who loves him and a cunning priest who guides him to the samurai path.

Mifune delivers one of his finest and most affecting performances as the bulbous-nosed poet-samurai who puts his own feelings aside to help another man woo the princess (Yoko Tsukasa) they both love.

After Sasuke is unwittingly drawn into the conflict, he tracks Tatewaki, while a mysterious, white-hooded figure seems to hunt them both. By tale’s end, no one is who they seemed to be, and the truth is far more personal than anyone suspected.

Starring Gong Li, Mark Chao, Joe Odagiri

The latest from acclaimed director Lou Ye—one of contemporary Chinese cinema’s boldest auteurs—is a stylish, spellbinding thriller built around a tour-de-force performance from the great Gong Li. It’s 1941, and China has become a wartime intelligence battlefield. Actor Jean Yu (Gong) returns to Shanghai, ostensibly to appear in the play “Saturday Fiction,” directed by her former lover. But what is her true aim? To free her ex-husband? To gather intelligence for the Allied forces? To work for her adoptive father? Or to escape from war with her lover? As she embarks on her mission, with friends ever more difficult to distinguish from undercover agents, Jean Yu starts to question whether to reveal what she has learned about the imminent Pearl Harbor attack."

Starring Albert Finney, Shirley Anne Field, Rachel Roberts

Adapted by Alan Sillitoe from his own influential debut novel, this quintessential kitchen-sink drama was one of the first films to give voice to the discontent of Britain’s working class. Arthur Seaton (Albert Finney in his breakthrough performance) is a twenty-two-year-old factory worker in Nottingham, a sprawling industrial city in the British Midlands. All week long he works hard at his lathe, asking and expecting nothing more than his weekly pay; but on Saturday evenings he asserts his independence by losing himself in drinking, brawling, and womanizing. When Brenda (Rachel Roberts), the wife of a coworker, becomes pregnant by Arthur, he begins to face the consequence of his reckless, devil-may-care ways."

Ingmar Bergman presents the battle of the sexes as a ramshackle, grotesque carnival of humiliation in SAWDUST AND TINSEL, one of the master’s most vivid early works and his first of many collaborations with the great cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The story of the charged relationship between a turn-of-the-twentieth-century circus owner (Åke Grönberg) and his younger mistress (Harriet Andersson), a horseback rider in the traveling show, the film features dreamlike detours and twisted psychosexual power plays, making for a piercingly brilliant depiction of physical and spiritual degradation."

Paul Muni gives an electrifying performance as Tony Camonte, an ambitious mobster with a ruthless drive to be the city’s top crime boss.

Leslie Howard steps into the foppish finery of the seemingly ineffectual English aristocrat who, as his quick-thinking alter ego the Scarlet Pimpernel, rescues innocents from the guillotine during the French Revolution. Boasting a superb cast that includes Merle Oberon and Raymond Massey, this crackling adventure offers one of cinema’s most unique heroes: a charming, cheeky dandy with the heart of a lion."

After her husband is killed in a car crash, a newly widowed woman (Yoko Tsukasa) sees her dreams for the future destroyed—only to find herself increasingly attracted to the man (Yuzo Kayama) responsible for the accident.

Sequestered in his home, a disgraced President Richard Milhous Nixon arms himself with a bottle of scotch and a gun to record memoirs that no one will hear. He is surrounded by the silent portraits of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Kissinger, and his mother, as he resurrects his past in a passionate attempt to defend himself and his political legacy. Based on the original play by Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone, and starring Philip Baker Hall in a tour de force solo performance, Robert Altman’s SECRET HONOR is a searing interrogation of the Nixon mystique and an audacious depiction of unchecked paranoia."

Made over the course of ten years, this epic work of activist cinema joins the citizens of Sennan, Osaka, as they embark on an unprecedented uphill legal battle to receive reparations from the government for exposing their community to the deadly toxins of the city’s asbestos factories. Through wrenching interviews with the victims whose lives have been shattered by the agonizing effects of asbestosis, SENNAN ASBESTOS DISASTER paints a damning portrait of how decades of negligence exacted a devastating human toll while revealing the ways in which the tragedy is deeply entwined with issues of class and anti-Korean discrimination. It’s also a galvanizing look at the power of collective action and what happens when ordinary people take on their own government—going up against an unfeeling, often maddeningly slow-moving bureaucracy in their unceasing fight for justice."

Once again exploring her signature obsessions, Breillat uses this metafictional format to investigate the ethical responsibilities of the artist, the messy logistics of running a set, and the slippery nature of realism, as applied to one of filmmaking’s most challenging ordeals: the simulated sex scene. Culminating in one actor’s ribald high jinks with a body prosthetic and another’s breakthrough into shattering emotional territory, SEX IS COMEDY is Breillat’s heady, brilliant synthesis of the ridiculous and the sublime."

Costarring major Fifth Generation filmmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang (THE HORSE THIEF, THE BLUE KITE), this rich, profoundly sensitive rumination on the possibility of human connection achieves a novelistic expansiveness as it surveys the ebbs and flows of a life shaped by loss, yearning, and regret."

John Cassavetes’s directorial debut revolves around a romance in New York City between Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), a light- skinned black woman, and Tony (Anthony Ray), a white man. The relationship is put in jeopardy when Tony meets Lelia’s darker-skinned jazz singer brother, Hugh (Hugh Hurd), and discovers that her racial heritage is not what he thought it was. Shot on location in Manhattan with a mostly nonprofessional cast and crew, SHADOWS is a penetrating work that is widely considered the forerunner of the American independent film movement."

Starring Woody Allen, Kathy Bates, Jodie Foster

Lensed in atmospheric monochrome chiaroscuro, Woody Allen’s absurdist homage to German expressionism (with dashes of Kafka and Ingmar Bergman), is one of the writer-director’s most offbeat experiments. Recruited by an inept mob of vigilantes, Kleinman (Allen), a cowardly clerk, is forced to search for a notorious murderer only to stumble upon a feisty sword-swallower, Irmy (Mia Farrow), running away from the circus. Determined to help Irmy, and eager to escape the vigilantes, Kleinman abandons his search for the killer . . . or so he thinks. Rushing headlong into the odious night, Kleinman and Irmy are launched into a mysterious world of shadows and fog from which they may never emerge."

Boiling down what is essentially a romantic comedy to a series of spare and beautiful gestures, Kaurismäki conjures an unexpected delight that finds hope blossoming even amid gray surroundings."

Directed by Ingmar Bergman, SHAME (SKAMMEN) is at once an examination of the violent legacy of World War II and a scathing response to the escalation of the conflict in Vietnam. Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann star as musicians living in quiet retreat on a remote island farm, until the civil war that drove them from the city catches up with them there. Amid the chaos of the military struggle, vividly evoked by pyrotechnics and by cinematographer Sven Nykvist’s handheld camera work, the two are faced with impossible moral choices that tear at the fabric of their relationship. This film, which contains some of the most devastating scenes in Bergman’s oeuvre, shows the impact of war on individual lives."

In the midst of the Second Sino-Japanese War, a soldier (Kenny Bee) and a young woman (Sylvia Chang) meet in darkness under a bridge during a bomb raid. Although they can’t see each other’s faces, they promise to meet again one day.

Nico Papatakis’s caustic political allegory—made in the wake of the 1967 Greek coup d’état that led to the establishment of a right-wing military junta—takes the form of a deliriously unhinged romantic tragedy. Beginning with the image of an exploding goat and only proceeding to get stranger from there, THE SHEPHERDS OF CALAMITY (also known as THANOS AND DESPINA) centers on the forbidden romance between a poor shepherd (George Dialegmenos) and the daughter (Olga Karlatos) of a well-off family who find their love beset by the machinations of those around them."

The family begins to unravel when the captain invites Sally to live on the ship, where she and Johannes form a tender connection.

Decades before the artistic triumph of neorealism and the cultural revolution of the feminist movement, director Lois Weber expressed the seeds of both in what is perhaps her greatest work: an almost documentary-like look at the everyday struggles of an ordinary young woman. Eva Meyer (sixteen-year-old Mary MacLaren, in a revelatory performance) is a poor shop girl working at a five-and-dime. Each week, Eva returns to her cold-water flat and dutifully hands over her meager earnings to her mother. But her wages barely cover the grocer’s bill and cannot provide for decent clothing. With only cardboard to patch the holes in the soles of her shoes, Eva’s life becomes harder with each rainy day and every splinter. In constant pain and with no solution in sight, the disheartened girl resorts to desperate measures."

The legendary midnight-movie sensation that firmly embedded samurai mythology within American pop-culture consciousness, this English-dubbed reedit of the first two films in the classic Japanese chanbara series LONE WOLF AND CUB is a giddily entertaining, mesmerizingly gory classic of East-meets-West grindhouse mayhem. Following the murder of his wife at the hands of an evil shogun, an avenging ronin (Tomisaburo Wakayama) roams the countryside with his young son—and the boy’s sword-shooting baby carriage—in tow, dispatching ninja assassins with steely resolve in operatically stylized flurries of hallucinatory violence. With its pulsing synth soundtrack (cowritten by Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere &amp;amp; the Raiders) and delirious action set pieces—kinetically edited whirlwinds of flashing blades, spurting blood, and severed limbs—SHOGUN ASSASSIN proved an instant cult favorite that has bubbled its way up from the underground thanks to its influence on artists ranging from the Wu-Tang Clan to Quentin Tarantino."

Jean-Pierre Melville began his superb feature filmmaking career with this powerful adaptation of an influential underground novel written during the Nazi occupation of France. A cultured, naively idealistic German officer is billeted in the home of a middle-aged man and his grown niece; their response to his presence—their only form of resistance—is complete silence. Constructed with elegant minimalism and shot, by the legendary Henri Decaë, with hushed eloquence, LE SILENCE DE LA MER points the way toward Melville’s later films about resistance and the occupation (LEON MORIN, PRIEST; ARMY OF SHADOWS) yet remains a singularly eerie masterwork in its own right."

SIMON OF THE DESERT is Luis Buñuel’s wicked and wild take on the life of devoted ascetic Saint Simeon Stylites, who waited atop a pillar surrounded by a barren landscape for six years, six months, and six days, in order to prove his devotion to God. Yet the devil, in the figure of the beautiful Silvia Pinal, huddles below, trying to tempt him down.

When Nicole (Suzanne Fletcher), a young copy-shop employee, is hired to translate an ancient Chinese manuscript, she soon finds that the document has strange powers that exert an eerie influence over her life. As women go bald, people mysteriously die, and Xerox machines seem to develop minds of their own, Driver guides this hypnagogic reverie into increasingly hallucinatory, dreamlike realms, aided by the striking chiaroscuro compositions of cinematographer Jim Jarmusch."

It’s the medical miracle heard round the world, as Marco becomes fodder for the press, a curiosity to the scientific community, and a cash cow for a maternity-wear company—while leaving his hairdresser wife (Catherine Deneuve) alternately gobsmacked and delighted. Jacques Demy, directing in his très charmant, candy-colored visual style, plays the absurdist premise for both cheery comedy and slyly subversive social commentary, raising serious questions about male-female social roles and gender equality."

During a weekend in the country, the women collude to force the men’s hands in matters of the heart, exposing their pretensions and insecurities along the way.

After escaping New Jersey, the quintessentially punk Wren (Susan Berman)—a spark plug in fishnets—moves to the city with the mission of becoming famous. When not pasting up self-promotional flyers or hanging at the Peppermint Lounge, she’s getting involved with Paul (Brad Rinn), the nicest guy to ever live in a van next to the highway, and Eric (Richard Hell), an aloof rocker. Shot on 16 mm film that captures the grit and glam of downtown in the 1980s, with an alternately moody and frenetic soundtrack by the Feelies and others, SMITHEREENS—the first American independent film to compete for the Palme d’Or—is an unfaded snapshot of a bygone era."

As their romance gets serious, the film grows anxious, leading to a wallop of a conclusion.

A furious howl of resistance against racist oppression, the debut from Mauritanian director Med Hondo is a bitterly funny, stylistically explosive attack on Western capitalism and the legacy of colonialism. Laced with deadly irony and righteous anger, SOLEIL Ô follows a starry-eyed immigrant (Robert Liensol) as he leaves West Africa and journeys to Paris in search of a job and cultural enrichment—but soon discovers a hostile society in which his very presence elicits fear and resentment. Drawing on the freewheeling stylistic experimentation of the French New Wave, Hondo deploys a dizzying array of narrative and stylistic techniques—animation, docudrama, dream sequences, musical numbers, folklore, slapstick comedy, agitprop—to create a revolutionary landmark of political cinema and a shattering vision of awakening black consciousness.

SOLEIL Ô was restored as part of the African Film Heritage Project, an initiative created by The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project, the Pan-African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), and UNESCO, in collaboration with the Cineteca di Bologna, to help locate, restore, and disseminate fifty African films with historic, artistic, and cultural significance. Restoration funding was provided by the George Lucas Family Foundation and The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project."

“ . . . people who move away from the gender they were assigned at birth [. . .] want to strike out toward some new location, some space not yet clearly defined or concretely occupied; [. . .] the movement across a socially imposed boundary away from an unchosen starting place.” —Susan Stryker, “Transgender History”

Somewhere a Destination

There are changes that I’m happy about, small ones that only I notice. The details on my skin or every new centimeter of hair, I watch them crawl like a trail of ants on the wall from an undecipherable nook of somewhere else. Sometimes I would hear whispers from my thighs and a humming by my arms, which come so unexpectedly like a breeze, the one that comes in on a busy street of a working afternoon. From a distance and without pausing, they may only seem to be a wall or just a busy street, but it still makes a body—even if it’s just one and only mine.

                                    “It can only be so rewarding,” I tell people whenever I’m asked how it feels to be in this body.

What other people notice is a collection of these changes in images. Ones they collect of a body from 2017 versus the images they have of it today. They recognize an image and assume that that is a certain destination of a body, while only so few can come close and maybe even pause to see that these images are moving, transitioning in perpetuity. Ambiguous details of an ambiguous destination.

I look up at the sky, it’s nighttime. On the left is one grey cloud and it stays there. I look straight at the tall buildings, all staying still. Some windows beam out a light, some are just about to be turned off. If I were by the sea, looking straight wouldn’t mean looking at stiff structures, but the sea, instead, of course. And it would curl in on itself, releasing to the shore. I imagine being there, knowing how much I miss its promise of always new images. I look to the skies again, the one that pairs with the buildings, and the cloud is on the middle. If it were 2pm, I would be hearing metal and wood from a construction nearby. There just always is one and it didn’t matter if it was in my line of sight or someplace else, something was always being built here. The one I am seeing now may promise new images; seeing new details added by its construction. But it has to be finished one day, and the changes it is meant to take would be final. New details would be decay, until its fixed to another defined image. And I watch the cloud. Slowly changing its position, moving closer to the right. It expands too, a new shape, a new thing anyone could imagine it to be. Moments ago, I was imagining the cloud as a person in a dress swaying, perhaps they were dancing. Now I’m imagining a wrist that softly points its hand somewhere. From where I sit looking on, only half of this horizon promises ambiguity, hopefully in perpetuity.

There can be glimpses of what feels rewarding. A recognition that something feels right, finally, brings this reward. When a body looks around a space and notices all the wrong things about it, in its rigidness and straight lines, a body starts to desire. This is when queerhood starts: desiring for a better place, somewhere far from present rigidness, somewhere vast and unexplored. 

And being there is like being with her, watching her get dressed and pick the right shoes to dance in. Sometimes she’d lend me her earrings or fix my hair before we head out. Being there feels like laughing with them while walking in a dark street. It feels dangerous, that in any moment uniformed men would force us to show identification and threaten us, then nothing happens. They and I continue to walk. It’s like being with him quietly looking for our seats in a movie house, sitting down and ready to watch. In this dark room, the light is on both our faces, slowly attaining inspiration. When we’re all watching a fireworks show— more light on our faces, changing in each boom and spark. Joy and astonishment. The fireworks are loud but we all cheered much louder, together. Even when one tried to catch their breath, to take a moment in, we were in chorus. 

                                    When you and I make a bed after sleeping in the afternoon. Checking all corners are tucked in tight. You offer me tea, knowing just how I like it. The sun starts to set, its orange blushes the white clouds. You say “the clouds are blushing”. You and I sit outside and watch until it’s all grey, before heading back inside for dinner. Being there is being with you.

Glimpses of somewhere, at least for now."

The occasion for this landmark event was a live performance of their album “Songs for Drella,” a wry and wrenching tribute to their recently deceased former manager Andy Warhol (the nickname, Drella, a portmanteau of Dracula and Cinderella, hints at the complex feelings the two men held for the artist, who exerted a Svengali-like influence over their early careers).

Following a twenty-five year break from feature filmmaking, Swedish existentialist Roy Andersson reintroduced his singular vision to the world with this by turns bleak and mordantly funny vision of the tragicomic absurdity of modern life. Forty-six seemingly random, deadpan, and precisely composed vignettes depict a mercilessly capitalist world in breakdown.

One of director Bertrand Tavernier’s most personal stories centers on successful filmmaker Bernard Rougerie (Michel Piccoli), who, while working on his latest project, suffers a creative block that leads him to separate from his wife and take a new apartment. There, he finds himself drawn into an affair with new neighbor Anne (Christine Pascal) while joining fellow residents in their fight against their unscrupulous landlord. Throughout, Tavernier balances an intimate story of love and creativity with commentary on class and gender dynamics."

This is where it all started. John Ford’s smash hit and enduring masterpiece STAGECOACH revolutionized the western, elevating it from B movie to the A-list and establishing the genre as we know it today. The quintessential tale of a group of strangers thrown together into extraordinary circumstances, STAGECOACH features outstanding performances from Hollywood stalwarts Claire Trevor, John Carradine, and Thomas Mitchell, and, of course, John Wayne, in his first starring role for Ford, as the daredevil outlaw the Ringo Kid.

When a pair of a detectives lose the trail of a murder suspect, they camp out across the street from his ex-lover (Hideko Takamine) in hopes that she will lead them to their man. It’s the beginning of an extended surveillance operation that gradually reveals as much about the woman they are watching—and the oppressive marriage she is trapped in—as the case they are investigating. Adapted by regular Kurosawa screenwriter Shinobu Hashimoto (RASHOMON, SEVEN SAMURAI) from a story by Seicho Matsumoto and directed with cool precision by noir specialist Yoshitaro Nomura, this slow-burn procedural blends a Hitchcockian study of voyeurism with an empathetic look at the circumstances of women in postwar Japan."

Andrei Tarkovsky’s final Soviet feature is a metaphys­ical journey through an enigmatic postapocalyptic landscape, and a rarefied cinematic experience like no other. A hired guide—the Stalker—leads a writer and a professor into the heart of the Zone, the restricted site of a long-ago disaster, where the three men eventually zero in on the Room, a place rumored to fulfill one’s most deeply held desires. Adapting a science-fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Tarkovsky created an immersive world with a wealth of material detail and a sense of organic atmosphere. A religious allegory, a reflection of contemporaneous political anxieties, a meditation on film itself—STALKER envelops the viewer by opening up a multitude of possible meanings."

In the sun-saturated San Fernando Valley, adult-film star Jane, a.k.a. Tess Steele (Dree Hemingway), hits the jackpot when she discovers several thousand dollars inside a thermos purchased at an elderly woman’s yard sale. After splurging on accessories and a manicure, Jane—racked by guilt—offers to assist the old widow, Sadie (Besedka Johnson), with shopping and other chores. Sensing a disruption of her comfortable solitude, Sadie tries fending off Jane’s overtures of friendship, but each gradually find in the other the loving relationship missing from their lives. As the pair’s mother-daughter bond deepens, however, Jane risks alienating her friend, roommate, and colleague Melissa (Stella Maeve). Once again focusing on those at the margins of society and capturing the details of an overlooked profession, director Sean Baker elicits revelatory performances from Hemingway (daughter of Mariel and great-granddaughter of Ernest) and the eighty-five-year-old Johnson (in her first and only screen role) for a profound, comic, and beautifully crafted story about the possibility of connection in a world of artifice and isolation."

Costa-Gavras puts the involvement of the United States in Latin American politics under the microscope in this arresting thriller. An urban guerrilla group, outraged at the counterinsurgency and torture training clandestinely organized by the CIA in their country (unnamed in the film), abducts a U.S. official (Yves Montand) to bargain for the release of political prisoners; soon the kidnapping becomes a media sensation, leading to violence. Cowritten by Franco Solinas, the electrifying STATE OF SIEGE piercingly critiques the American government for supporting foreign dictatorships, while also asking difficult questions about the efficacy of radical violent acts to oppose such regimes."

He stars as the sensitive son of a gruff riverboat captain (Ernest Torrence) who struggles to earn both his father’s respect and the love of beautiful Marion Byron.

The lyrical, profoundly moving STILL WALKING (ARUITEMO ARUITEMO) is contemporary Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda&#39;s most personal work to date. Created as a tribute to his late mother, the film depicts one day in the life of the Yokoyamas, gathered together for a commemorative ritual whose nature only gradually becomes clear. Rather than focus on big dramatic moments, Kore-eda relies on simple gestures and domestic routines (especially cooking) to evoke a family’s entire life, its deep regrets and its daily joys. Featuring vivid, heartrending performances and a gentle naturalism that harks back to the director’s earlier, documentary work, STILL WALKING is an extraordinary portrayal of the ties that bind us."

One of a string of late-career masterworks made by Kenji Mizoguchi in the first half of the 1950s, A STORY FROM CHIKAMATSU (a.k.a. THE CRUCIFIED LOVERS) is an exquisitely moving tale of forbidden love struggling to survive in the face of persecution. Based on a classic of eighteenth-century Japanese drama, the film traces the injustices that befall a Kyoto scroll maker’s wife and his apprentice after each is unfairly accused of wrongdoing. Bound by fate in an illicit, star-crossed romance, they go on the run in search of refuge from the punishment prescribed them: death. Shot in gorgeous, painterly style by master cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, this delicately delivered indictment of societal oppression was heralded by Akira Kurosawa as a “great masterpiece that could only have been made by Mizoguchi.”

Unable to break into segregated Hollywood, Van Peebles decamped to France, taught himself the language, and wrote a number of books in French, one of which, “La permission,” would become the stylistically innovative THE STORY OF A THREE DAY PASS. Turner (Harry Baird), an African American soldier stationed in France, is granted a promotion and a three-day leave from base by his casually racist commanding officer and heads to Paris, where he finds whirlwind romance with a white woman (Nicole Berger)—but what happens to their love when his furlough is over? Channeling the brash exuberance of the French New Wave, Van Peebles creates an exploration of the psychology of an interracial relationship as well as a commentary on France’s contradictory attitudes about race that is playful, sarcastic, and stingingly subversive by turns, and that laid the foundation for the scorched-earth cinematic revolution he would let loose just a few years later."

Setting his later version in a seaside location, Ozu otherwise preserves the details of his elegantly simple plot wherein an aging actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his former lover and illegitimate son, a scenario that enrages his current mistress and results in heartbreak for all. Together, the films offer a unique glimpse into the evolution of one of cinema’s greatest directors. A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS reveals Ozu in the midst of developing his mode of expression; FLOATING WEEDS reveals his distinct style at its pinnacle.

Kikunosuke (Shotaro Hanayagi), the adopted son of a legendary kabuki actor who is striving to achieve stardom by mastering female roles, turns to his infant brother’s wet nurse for support and affection—and she soon gives up everything for her beloved’s creative glory.

Starring André Gille, Pascal Lamorisse, Maurice Baquet

Following the international triumph of THE RED BALLOON, Albert Lamorisse turned to feature filmmaking with another delightful tale of a boy and a balloon. Making spectacular use of Hélivision—an innovative aerial photography technique he developed—Lamorisse takes us on the breathtaking odyssey of a young boy (played by his son, Pascal) who sneaks aboard his inventor grandfather’s experimental new hot-air balloon for a voyage across France. Soaring above cathedrals and castles, the Mediterranean and the Alps, STOWAWAY IN THE SKY celebrates the natural world and ponders, with surprising existential insight, the place of human beings within it."

Starring Giulietta Masina, Anthony Quinn, Richard Basehart

With this breakthrough film, Federico Fellini launched both himself and his wife and collaborator Giulietta Masina to international stardom, breaking with the neorealism of his early career in favor of a personal, poetic vision of life as a bittersweet carnival. The infinitely expressive Masina registers both childlike wonder and heartbreaking despair as Gelsomina, loyal companion to the traveling strongman Zampanò (Anthony Quinn, in a toweringly physical performance), whose callousness and brutality gradually wear down her gentle spirit. Winner of the very first Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, LA STRADA (“The Road”) possesses the purity and timeless resonance of a fable and remains one of cinema’s most exquisitely moving visions of humanity struggling to survive in the face of life’s cruelties."

Jarmusch follows rootless Hungarian émigré Willie (John Lurie), his pal Eddie (Richard Edson), and his visiting sixteen-year-old cousin, Eva (Eszter Balint), as they drift from New York’s Lower East Side to the snowy expanses of Lake Erie and the drab beaches of Florida, always managing to make the least of wherever they end up.

In 1945, the free world rejoiced over the defeat of fascism. But the sense of peace was short-lived, and as the Cold War began, the United States entered a period of national paranoia and political repression. In response, boundary-pushing publisher and producer Barney Rosset and director Leo Hurwitz joined forces to create STRANGE VICTORY. This rarely seen, stylistically bold documentary equals the visual brilliance of landmark works like BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN and I AM CUBA while delivering an extraordinary cry for equality and justice. Skillfully combining real-life footage of World War II combat, postwar refugees, and the Nuremberg trials with powerful dramatic reenactments, Hurwitz weaves an extraordinary cinematic portrait of postwar American fascism. How could it be, the film asks, that servicemen returning home from defeating a racist and genocidal enemy found a United States plagued by prejudice, Jim Crow, anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and xenophobia?"

Born from a “Life” magazine exposé by Mark and McCall, “Streetwise” follows an unforgettable group of at-risk children—including iron-willed fourteen-year-old Tiny, who would become the project’s most haunting and enduring face, along with the pugnacious yet resourceful Rat and the affable drifter DeWayne—who, driven from their broken homes, survive by hustling, panhandling, and dumpster diving.

With this sublimely bittersweet tale of romantic longing, director David Lean left behind the British soundstage to capture in radiant Technicolor the sun-splashed glory of Venice at the height of summer. In a tour de force of fearless vulnerability, Katharine Hepburn portrays the conflicting emotions that stir the heart of a lonely, middle-aged American tourist who is forced to confront her insecurities when she is drawn into a seemingly impossible affair with a charming Italian shopkeeper (Rossano Brazzi) amid the ancient city’s canals and piazzas. Lean’s personal favorite among his own films, SUMMERTIME is an exquisitely tender evocation of the magic and melancholy of a fleeting, not-quite-fairy-tale romance."

Starring Harriet Andersson, Lars Ekborg

Inspired by the earthy eroticism of Harriet Andersson, in the first of her many roles for him, Ingmar Bergman had a major international breakthrough with this sensual and ultimately ravaging tale of young love. A girl (Andersson) and boy (Lars Ekborg) from working-class families in Stockholm run away from home to spend a secluded, romantic summer at the beach, far from parents and responsibilities. Inevitably, it is not long before the pair are forced to return to reality. The version initially released in the U.S. was reedited by its distributor into something more salacious, but the original SUMMER WITH MONIKA (SOMMAREN MED MONIKA), presented here, is a work of stunning maturity and one of Bergman’s most important films."

On this particular day, however, they are joined by Ladmiral’s daughter (Sabine Azéma), a free-spirited woman whose boisterous energy conceals a hidden complexity. As the day wears on, the small disappointments and regrets that shape the lives of Ladmiral and his children are gradually revealed."

Ten years after making his mark on Spanish cinema with THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE, Víctor Erice returned to filmmaking with this adaptation of a novella by Adelaida García Morales, which deepens the director’s fascination with childhood, fantasy, and the legacy of his country’s civil war. In the North of Spain, Estrella grows up captivated by her father, a doctor with mystical powers—and by the enigma of his youth in the South, a near-mythical region whose secrets haunt Estrella more and more as time goes on. Though Erice’s original vision also encompassed a section set in the South itself, scenes that were never shot, EL SUR remains an experience of rare perfection and satisfaction, drawing on painterly cinematography by José Luis Alcaine to evoke the enchantments of memory and the inaccessible, inescapable mysteries of the past."

A landmark of Black and American independent cinema that would send shock waves through the culture, SWEET SWEETBACK’S BAADASSSSS SONG was Melvin Van Peebles’s second feature film, after he walked away from a contract with Columbia in order to make his next film on his own terms. Acting as producer, director, writer, composer, editor, and star, Van Peebles created the prototype for what Hollywood would eventually co-opt and make into the blaxploitation hero: a taciturn, perpetually blank-faced performer in a sex show, who, when he’s pushed too far by a pair of racist cops looking to frame him for a crime he didn’t commit, goes on the run through a lawless underground of bikers, revolutionaries, sex workers, and hippies in a kill-or-be-killed quest for liberation from white oppression. SWEET SWEETBACK’S BAADASSSSS SONG’s incendiary politics are matched by Van Peebles’s revolutionary style, in which jagged jump cuts, kaleidoscopic superimpositions, and psychedelic sound design come together in a sustained howl of rage and defiance.

Crammed with incident even by the standards of the genre, the breathless plot follows the fortunes of a good-natured young warrior (Sam Hui) who finds himself drawn into the intrigue surrounding a stolen scroll containing supernatural secrets.

A couple enacts a breakup scenario over and over, a documentary crew films a crew filming the crew, locals wander casually into the frame: the project defies easy description. Yet this wildly innovative sixties counterculture landmark remains one of the most tightly focused and insightful movies ever made about making movies, expanded thirty-five years later by its unconventional follow-up, SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: TAKE 2½.

The first documents the Stones composing their epic song “Sympathy for the Devil” in a London studio as they write material for their forthcoming “Beggar’s Banquet” album. The other presents a series of abstract fictional vignettes, in which Godard explores everything from the Black Power movement to pornography to the relationship between culture and revolution."

Directed by Edward Yang • 1985 • Taiwan
Starring Hou Hsiao-hsien, Tsai Chin

Edward Yang’s second feature is a mournful anatomy of a city caught between the past and the present. Made in collaboration with Yang&#39;s fellow New Taiwan Cinema master Hou Hsiao-hsien, TAIPEI STORY chronicles the growing estrangement between a washed-up baseball player (Hou, in a rare on-screen performance) working in his family’s textile business and his girlfriend (Tsai Chin), who clings to the upward mobility of her career in property development. As the couple&#39;s dreams of marriage and emigration begin to unravel, Yang’s gaze illuminates the precariousness of domestic life and the desperation of Taiwan’s globalized modernity.

Restored by The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project at the Cineteca di Bologna/L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, in association with the Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique and Hou Hsiao-hsien."

The American dream has rarely seemed so far away as in Sean Baker and Shih-Ching Tsou’s raw, vérité TAKE OUT, an immersion in the life of an undocumented Chinese immigrant struggling to get by on the margins of post-9/11 New York City. Facing violent retaliation from a loan shark, restaurant deliveryman Ming Ding has until nightfall to pay back the money he owes, and he encounters both crushing setbacks and moments of unexpected humanity as he races against time to earn enough in tips over the course of a frantic day. From this simple setup, Baker and Tsou fashion a kind of neorealist survival thriller of the everyday, shedding compassionate light on the too often overlooked lives and labor that keep New York running."

Filmmaking legend Roberto Rossellini brings his passion for realism and unerring eye for the everyday to this portrait of the early years of the reign of France’s “Sun King,” and in the process reinvents the costume drama. The death of chief minister Cardinal Mazarin, the construction of the palace at Versailles, the extravagant meals of the royal court: all are recounted with the same meticulous quotidian detail that Rossellini brought to his contemporary portraits of postwar Italy. THE TAKING OF POWER BY LOUIS XIV dares to place a larger-than-life figure at the level of mere mortal."

The concluding installment of the Tales of the Four Seasons tetralogy is a breezy take on the classic American romantic comedies that influenced Eric Rohmer and his New Wave peers. Set in the Rhône Valley and taking full advantage of its golden vineyards, A TALE OF AUTUMN concerns simultaneous schemes to find a new love for reserved winegrower and widow Magali (Béatrice Romand). While Magali’s son’s girlfriend (Alexia Portal) attempts to pair her with a former professor and lover (Didier Sandre), Magali’s friend Isabelle (Marie Rivière) assumes a false identity in order to lure eligible bachelor Gérald (Alain Libolt). The misunderstandings that follow are pure Rohmer in revealing the humor of human folly and foibles."

In the first film of Tales of the Four Seasons, a burgeoning friendship between philosophy teacher Jeanne (Anne Teyssèdre) and pianist Natacha (Florence Darel) is strained by jealousy, suspicion, and intrigue. Natacha encourages Jeanne to pursue the former’s father, Igor (Hugues Quester), in order to supplant Eve (Eloïse Bennett), the young girlfriend Natacha loathes. Natacha’s scheme, however, risks alienating those closest to her as well as entangling Jeanne in a romantic drama she has vowed to avoid.

According to Eric Rohmer, the third film of Tales of the Four Seasons is his “most personal vehicle.” Based on events from Rohmer’s youth, A TALE OF SUMMER follows amateur musician Gaspard (Melvil Poupaud) to a seaside resort in Dinard, on the coast of Brittany. There, each of three women (Amanda Langlet, Gwenaëlle Simon, and Aurelia Nolin) offers the possibility of romance, but Gaspard’s inability to commit to just one puts all of his chances at love in jeopardy.

As tensions mount between rival yakuza clans, one boss hires a formidable but ailing ronin as his clan’s muscle, while the other employs a humble, moral blind masseur named Ichi. With its lightning-fast swordplay, sleight-of-hand dice games, and codes of honor upheld and betrayed, this first chapter sets the stage for all the ZATOICHI adventures to come.

Directed by Tony Richardson, a leading light of that movement, and based on one of the most controversial plays of its time, A TASTE OF HONEY stars Rita Tushingham, in a star-making debut role, as a disaffected teenager finding her way amid the economic desperation of industrial Manchester, and despite an absent, self-absorbed mother. With its unapologetic identification with social outcasts and its sensitive, modern approach to matters of sexuality and race, Richardson&#39;s classic is a still startling benchmark work of realism."

He did this by making one of his characters deaf (rendering speech unnecessary) and having much of the dialogue spoken off-camera (so it could be dubbed later).

One of the iconoclastic Pier Paolo Pasolini’s most radical provocations finds the auteur moving beyond the poetic, proletarian earthiness that first won him renown and notoriety with a coolly cryptic exploration of bourgeois spiritual emptiness. Terence Stamp stars as the mysterious stranger—perhaps an angel, perhaps a devil—who, one by one, seduces the members of a wealthy Milanese family (including European cinema icons Silvana Mangano, Massimo Girotti, Laura Betti, and Anne Wiazemsky), precipitating an existential crisis in each of their lives. Unfolding nearly wordlessly in a procession of sacred and profane images, this tantalizing metaphysical riddle—blocked from exhibition by the Catholic Church for degeneracy—is at once a blistering Marxist treatise on sex, religion, and art and a primal scream into the void."

This fateful visit commences an epic narrative of sex, class, betrayal, and revenge, which Polanski unfolds with deliberation and finesse. With its earthy visual textures, achieved by two world-class cinematographers—Geoffrey Unsworth (CABARET) and Ghislain Cloquet (AU HASARD BALTHAZAR)—TESS is a work of great pastoral beauty as well as vivid storytelling."

Locked away in an asylum for a decade and teetering between life and death, the criminal mastermind Doctor Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) has scribbled his last will and testament: a manifesto establishing a future empire of crime. When the document’s nefarious writings start leading to terrifying parallels in reality, it’s up to Berlin’s star detective, Inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke, reprising his role from M) to connect the most fragmented, maddening clues in a case unlike any other. A sequel to his enormously successful silent film DR. MABUSE: THE GAMBLER, Fritz Lang’s THE TESTAMENT OF DR. MABUSE reunites the director with the character that had effectively launched his career. Lang put slogans and ideas expounded by the Nazis into the mouth of a madman, warning his audience of an imminent menace, which was soon to become a reality. Nazi Minister of Information Joseph Goebbels saw the film as an instruction manual for terrorist action against the government and banned it for “endangering public order and security.” A landmark of mystery and suspense for countless espionage and noir thrillers to come, this is the complete, uncut original director’s version in a stunning new transfer."

An early Sundance hit but virtually unseen for decades, the film reemerges as a singular, uncategorizable exploration of the meaning of life, death, and the tangled stuff that is a family.

By turns darkly funny and tender, this unusually frank and nuanced portrait of family dysfunction features pitch-perfect performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney as Jon and Wendy Savage, estranged siblings who, until recently, shared nothing in common except their lousy childhood and a few strands of DNA. But after years of drifting apart, they’re forced to band together to care for the elderly, cantankerous father who made their formative years such a pain. In the process, both of these aimless, perpetually adolescent fortysomethings may just, at long last, have to grow up."

Incorporating stylized reenactments, penetrating interviews, and haunting original music by Philip Glass, Morris uses cinema to build a case forensically while effortlessly entertaining his viewers.

Skipping through time, THINGS TO COME bears witness to world war, disease, dictatorship, and, finally, utopia. Conceived, written, and overseen by Wells himself as an adaptation of his own work, this megabudget production, the most ambitious ever from Korda’s London Films, is a triumph of imagination and technical audacity."

Based on a novel by leftist author Norio Nanjo, THE THIRD SHADOW WARRIOR weaves the twisty tale of Kyonosuke Ninomiya (Raizo Ichikawa), a young peasant whose dreams of becoming a samurai seemingly come true when he is recruited to serve as a lookalike decoy for a merciless warlord. But rather than the glory he envisioned, Ninomiya is thrust into a vicious power struggle and a nightmarish identity crisis from which there may be no escape."

A rare film biography as boldly unconventional as its subject, writer-director François Girard’s visionary portrait of iconoclastic, world-renowned pianist Glenn Gould explodes the conventions of the form to illuminate the brilliant mind and innermost obsessions of a singular artist. Across thirty-two vignettes encompassing everything from dramatic sketches to documentary interviews to avant-garde animation, THIRTY TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD pieces together the story of Gould’s trajectory from child prodigy to celebrated concert pianist who turned his back on public performance to pursue his all-consuming fascination with recording technology. Led by a tour-de-force performance by Colm Feore and underscored by Gould’s landmark recordings of Bach’s “Goldberg Variations,” Girard’s film daringly deconstructs the enigma of genius."

Taking a hip-shaking stroll from New Orleans to Appalachia, filmmakers Chris Simon and Maureen Gosling come face-to-face with the creators of indigenous music, including King of Zydeco Clifton Chenier, fiddler Michael Doucet, Norteño great Flaco Jiménez, and Cajun outfit the Pine Leaf Boys.

With a poet’s eye for place, light, and the spiritual dimensions of everyday existence, Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese crafts a meditation on the concept of homeland and a transcendent elegy for what is lost in the name of progress. Grieving and alone following the deaths of her husband and children, elderly Mantoa (Mary Twala Mhlongo, in a soul-shaking end-of-life performance) prepares for her own death and to be buried alongside her ancestors. When plans for a new dam near her village in the landlocked kingdom of Lesotho threaten to literally wash away all she holds dear, Mantoa takes a last stand, mobilizing her neighbors to fight for their land and their way of life. The experience of watching Mosese’s visionary, much-lauded THIS IS NOT A BURIAL, IT’S A RESURRECTION is as timeless and elemental as the land itself."

While appealing his sentence, Panahi is seen talking to his family and lawyer on the phone, discussing his plight with codirector Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, and reflecting on the meaning of the art of filmmaking.

Starring Ursula Schult, Guido Wieland, Walter Schmidinger

Adapted from a story by celebrated writer Ingeborg Bachmann, this early television film by Michael Haneke finds the Austrian auteur already exploring some of his key themes—of family dynamics, media, and the relationship between the individual and society at large—with subtle flashes of the famously rigorous style he would later develop. While visiting her elderly father in the small countryside town where she grew up, Elisabeth (Ursula Schult), a renowned war photographer, must reckon with both past memories and the meaning of her work."

The sly melodies of composer Kurt Weill and the daring of dramatist Bertolt Brecht come together on-screen under the direction of German auteur G. W. Pabst (PANDORA’S BOX) in this classic adaptation of the Weimar-era theatrical sensation. Set in the impoverished back alleys of Victorian London, THE THREEPENNY OPERA follows underworld antihero Mackie Messer (a.k.a. Mack the Knife) as he tries to woo Polly Peachum and elude the authorities. With its palpable evocation of corruption and dread, set to Weill’s irresistible score, THE THREEPENNY OPERA remains a benchmark of early sound cinema. It is presented here in both its celebrated German and rare French versions."

In Kira Muratova’s darkly ironic triptych, three seemingly unlikely people are driven to murder—shocking acts of violence rendered by the director as a kind of monstrous comedy of the absurd. A mild-mannered clerk’s annoyance with his troublesome neighbor reaches the breaking point, a misanthropic hospital worker channels her anger at her mother into a startling act of revenge, and a sweetly innocent-seeming young girl turns out to be capable of the most heinous of crimes. Working in her famously abstract style, Muratova uses these grimly farcical tales to explore the inherent irrationality of human nature."

This enchanting Czech Christmas classic has become a Central European yuletide staple thanks to its perennial presence on television each holiday season. A charming, spirited twist on the classic fairy tale, THREE WISHES FOR CINDERELLA updates the beloved story with a picturesque, woodsy wintertime setting and a refreshingly sharp-witted, assertive heroine (Libuše Šafránková), a housemaid who uses her wits and many talents—along with a bit of help from some magical hazelnuts—to win her prince and find her happily ever after."

As a hardened warrior who rises savagely to power, Toshiro Mifune gives a remarkable, animalistic performance, as does Isuzu Yamada as his ruthless wife.

While vacationing on a remote island retreat, a family finds its fragile ties tested when daughter Karin (an astonishing Harriet Andersson) discovers her father (Gunnar Björnstrand) has been using her schizophrenia for his own literary ends. As she drifts in and out of lucidity, Karin’s father, her husband (Max von Sydow), and her younger brother (Lars Passgård) are unable to prevent her descent into the abyss of mental illness. Winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY, the first work in Ingmar Bergman’s trilogy on faith and the loss of it, presents an unflinching vision of a family’s near disintegration and a tortured psyche further taunted by the intangibility of God’s presence."

Abbas Kiarostami takes metanarrative gamesmanship to masterful new heights in the final installment of THE KOKER TRILOGY. Unfolding “behind the scenes” of AND LIFE GOES ON, this film traces the complications that arise when the romantic misfortune of one of the actors—a young man who pines for the woman cast as his wife, even though, in real life, she will have nothing to do with him—creates turmoil on set and leaves the hapless director caught in the middle. An ineffably lovely, gentle human comedy steeped in the folkways of Iranian village life, THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES peels away layer after layer of artifice as it investigates the elusive, alchemical relationship between cinema and reality."

One of the most personal films by the prolific Hong Kong auteur Johnnie To is a thrilling love letter to both the cinema of Akira Kurosawa and the art and philosophy of judo. Amid the neon-drenched nightclubs and gambling dens of Hong Kong’s nocturnal underworld, the fates of three wandering souls—a former judo champion now barely scraping by as an alcoholic bar owner (Louis Koo), a young fighter (Aaron Kwok) intent on challenging him, and a singer (Cherrie Ying) chasing dreams of stardom—collide in an operatic explosion of human pain, ambition, perseverance, and redemption. Paying offbeat homage to Kurosawa’s debut feature, SANSHIRO SUGATA, To scrambles wild comedy, flights of lyrical surrealism, and rousing martial-arts action into what is ultimately a disarmingly touching ode to the healing power of friendship."

The film chronicles the struggles of Rev. L. William Youngdahl, pastor of the Augustana Lutheran Church in Omaha, Nebraska, as he tries to persuade members of his all-white congregation to reach out to their Black neighbors in an attempt to right some of the wrongs of systemic racism. A TIME FOR BURNING captures both the resistance of the white churchgoers, who speak candidly about their fears of integration, and the incisive perspectives of the Black residents (including firebrand activist and future state senator Ernie Chambers) who see through the hypocrisy of the church."

A true twentieth-century trailblazer, Harvey Milk was an outspoken human rights activist and one of the first openly gay U.S. politicians elected to public office; even after his assassination in 1978, he continues to inspire disenfranchised people around the world. The Oscar-winning The Times of Harvey Milk, directed by Robert Epstein and produced by Richard Schmiechen, was as groundbreaking as its subject. One of the first feature documentaries to address gay life in America, it&#39;s a work of advocacy itself, bringing Milk&#39;s message of hope and equality to a wider audience. This exhilarating trove of original documentary material and archival footage is as much a vivid portrait of a time and place (San Francisco&#39;s historic Castro District in the seventies) as a testament to the legacy of a political visionary."

Thirty years in the making, TINY: THE LIFE OF ERIN BLACKWELL continues to follow one of the most indelible subjects of STREETWISE, a groundbreaking documentary on homeless and runaway teenagers. Erin Blackwell, a.k.a. Tiny, was introduced in filmmaker Martin Bell, photographer Mary Ellen Mark, and journalist Cheryl McCall&#39;s earlier film as a brash fourteen-year-old living precariously on the margins in Seattle. Now a forty-four year-old mother of ten, Blackwell reflects with Mark on the journey they’ve experienced together, from Blackwell’s struggles with addiction to her regrets to her dreams for her own children, even as she sees them being pulled down the same path of drugs and desperation. Interweaving three decades’ worth of Mark’s photographs and footage that includes previously unseen outtakes from STREETWISE, this is a heartrending, deeply empathetic portrait of a family struggling to break free of the cycle of trauma, as well as a summation of the life’s work of Mark, an irreplaceable artistic voice."

In this jazzy gangster film, reformed killer Tetsu’s attempt to go straight is thwarted when his former cohorts call him back to Tokyo to help battle a rival gang. Director Seijun Suzuki’s onslaught of stylized violence and trippy colors is equal parts Russ Meyer, Samuel Fuller, and Nagisa Oshima—an anything-goes, in-your-face rampage. TOKYO DRIFTER is a delirious highlight of the brilliantly excessive Japanese cinema of the sixties."

A spectacle of magnificent proportions and remarkable intimacy, Kon Ichikawa’s TOKYO OLYMPIAD remains one of the greatest films ever made about sports. Supervising a vast team of technicians using scores of cameras, Ichikawa captured the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo in glorious widescreen images, using cutting-edge telephoto lenses and exquisite slow motion to create lyrical, idiosyncratic poetry from the athletic drama surging all around him. Drawn equally to the psychology of losers and winners—including the legendary Ethiopian marathoner Abebe Bikila, who receives the film’s most exalted tribute—Ichikawa captures the triumph, passion, and suffering of competition with a singular humanistic vision, and in doing so effected a transformative influence on the art of documentary filmmaking."

Laure/Mikael code-switches between being at home with their family and hanging out with their neighborhood pals and new girlfriend — all the while finding resourceful ways to navigate the summer.

In the early 1960s, at the height of the British New Wave, director Tony Richardson and playwright John Osborne set out for more fanciful territory than the gritty realism of the movement they’d helped establish. TOM JONES brings a theatrical flair to Henry Fielding’s canonical eighteenth-century novel, boisterously chronicling the misadventures of the foundling of the title (Albert Finney, in a career-defining performance), whose easy charm seems to lead him astray at every turn from his beloved, the wellborn Sophie Western (Susannah York). This spirited picaresque, evocatively shot in England’s rambling countryside and featuring an extraordinary ensemble cast, went on to become a worldwide sensation, winning the Oscar for best picture on the way to securing its status as a classic of irreverent wit and playful cinematic expression."

At the Lusman Arms, a once-luxurious Hollywood hotel now undergoing renovations, a serial killer is murdering residents one by one using—surprise, surprise—all manner of repair equipment in the most grisly ways imaginable.

From two-time Palme d’Or winners Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (TWO DAYS, ONE NIGHT) comes the story of seventeen-year-old Lokita and twelve-year-old Tori (in remarkable debut performances from Joely Mbundu and Pablo Schils), two immigrants—from Cameroon and Benin, respectively—whose sibling-like bond is the only resource they can depend on in their struggle for survival on the margins of European society. The inseparable pair work as performers in a cheap trattoria, dealing drugs on the side for the restaurant’s abusive cook, while balancing the demands of an indifferent bureaucracy and a band of violent smugglers. When Lokita is held captive while working in a marijuana grow house, Tori scrambles to save his companion from their abusers, as events spiral out of control. Winner of the 75th Anniversary Prize at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, the latest humanist drama from the Dardenne brothers is a heart-stopping thriller that casts an unflinching eye on the trials of the young and dispossessed.

A slow-burning masterwork of the early 1990s, this third feature by Charles Burnett is a singular piece of American mythmaking. In a towering performance, Danny Glover plays the enigmatic southern drifter Harry, a devilish charmer who turns up out of the blue on the South Central Los Angeles doorstep of his old friends. In short order, Harry’s presence seems to cast a chaotic spell on what appeared to be a peaceful household, exposing smoldering tensions between parents and children, tradition and change, virtue and temptation. Interweaving evocative strains of gospel and blues with rich, poetic-realist images, TO SLEEP WITH ANGER is a sublimely stirring film from an autonomous artistic sensibility, a portrait of family resilience steeped in the traditions of African American mysticism and folklore."

Across fifteen jagged episodes, TOTALLY F***ED UP plunges headlong into the lives of a group of queer, disaffected Los Angeles teenagers who form a kind of makeshift family as they navigate desire and heartbreak, societal and familial rejection, and the alienation of growing up gay in an era of relentless moralizing. Both a defiantly raw anthem of outsiderhood and a furious reckoning with all-American homophobia, Araki’s answer to the 1980s teen comedy captures youthful angst with an immediacy that still bruises."

In Chantal Akerman’s singular TOUTE UNE NUIT, the modern city and its inhabitants are captured in fragmentary, elliptical visions of desire, frustration, and loneliness, with more than two dozen characters appearing in fleeting vignettes that tease the possibility of larger narratives. Alongside her magnum opus JEANNE DIELMAN, TOUTE UNE NUIT is one of the legendary Belgian director’s greatest triumphs: a charming, avant-garde melodrama that is as much about the weight of time as the longing for connection."

Starring Jacques Tati

In Jacques Tati’s TRAFIC, the bumbling Monsieur Hulot, kitted out as always with tan raincoat, beaten brown hat, and umbrella, takes to Paris’s highways and byways. In this, his final outing, Hulot is employed as an auto company’s director of design, and accompanies his new product (a “camping car” outfitted with absurd gadgetry) to an auto show in Amsterdam. Naturally, the road there is paved with modern-age mishaps. This late-career delight is a masterful demonstration of the comic genius’s expert timing and sidesplitting knack for visual gags, and a bemused last look at technology run amok."

Directed by Ahmed El Maânouni • 1981 • Morocco

The beloved Moroccan band Nass El Ghiwane is the dynamic subject of this captivating musical documentary. Storytellers through song, with connections to political theater, the band became an international sensation (Western music critics have often referred to them as “the Rolling Stones of North Africa”) thanks to their political lyrics and sublime, fully acoustic sound, which draws on the Moroccan trance music tradition. Both a concert movie and a free-form audiovisual experiment, Ahmed El Maânouni&#39;s TRANCES is cinematic poetry.

Directed by Ermanno Olmi • 1978 • Italy
Starring Luigi Ornaghi, Francesca Moriggi, Omar Brignoli

A painterly and sensual immersion in late nineteenth-century Italian farm life, Ermanno Olmi’s THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS lovingly focuses on four families working for one landowner on an isolated estate in the province of Bergamo. Filming on an abandoned farm for four months, Olmi adapted neorealist techniques to tell his story, enlisting local people to live as their own ancestors had, speaking in their native dialect on locations with which they were intimately familiar. Through the cycle of seasons, of backbreaking labor, love and marriage, birth and death, faith and superstition, Olmi naturalistically evokes an existence very close to nature, celebrating its beauty, humor, and simplicity but also acknowledging the feudal cruelty that governs it. Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1978, THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS is intimate in scale but epic in scope, a towering, heart-stirring work of humanist filmmaking.

Fourteen years after Hollywood ran aground with its film of Joan of Arc (starring Ingrid Bergman), French filmmaker Robert Bresson turned his attention to the last part of Joan&#39;s life, and the result was a stark and beautifully compact retelling of the tale, based on the actual surviving records of her trial. With Florence Delay as the martyred saint, in a presentation intended to make her accessible to modern younger viewers, the result was somewhere between a legitimate hagiographical film and the precursor to Zeffirelli&#39;s youth-oriented Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet, made a half-decade later."

A feverishly inspired take on Franz Kafka’s novel, Orson Welles’s THE TRIAL casts Anthony Perkins as the bewildered office drone Josef K., whose arrest for an unspecified crime plunges him into a menacing bureaucratic labyrinth of guilt, corruption, and paranoia. Exiled from Hollywood and creatively unchained, Welles poured his ire at the studio system, the blacklist, and all forms of totalitarian oppression into this cinematic statement—a bold, personal film that he himself considered one of his greatest. Dizzying camera angles, expressionistic lighting, increasingly surreal locations—Welles unleashed the full force of his visual brilliance to convey the nightmarish disorientation of a world gone mad."

Journeying from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi to the Ancient Agora of Athens to the unique island of Hydra and beyond, they argue hilariously about tragedy and comedy, astronomy and biology, myth, history, democracy, and the meaning of life."

Newlyweds Shane (a perfectly cast Vincent Gallo) and June (Tricia Vessey) arrive in Paris for their honeymoon.

A lifetime military man, Sinclair expects respect and loyalty from his men. But when Basil Barrow (John Mills)—an educated, by-the-book scion of a military family—enters the scene as Sinclair’s replacement, the two men engage in a fierce struggle for control of both the battalion and the hearts and minds of its men. Based on the novel by James Kennaway and featuring flawless performances by Guinness and Mills, TUNES OF GLORY uses the rigid stratification of military life to comment on the institutional contradictions and class hierarchies of English society, making for an unexpectedly moving drama."

A collaboration between musician and artist ANOHNI and pioneering video artist Charles Atlas (HAIL THE NEW PURITAN, BECAUSE WE MUST), TURNING follows the 2006 European tour of Antony and the Johnsons. Having risen to visibility after being awarded the UK Mercury Prize in 2005, ANOHNI elected to invite thirteen female artists, outsiders, and NYC transsexuals to join her on an ambassadorial presentation across Europe, at theaters including the Olympia and the Barbican. Iconic participants, including Connie Fleming, Honey Dijon, Kembra Pfahler, Joey Gabriel, Eliza Douglas, Johanna Constantine, and Nomi Ruiz, were filmed at close range on a rotating stage and simultaneously projected on a giant screen behind the musicians, forming a hypnotic and transformative axis of modern femininity. TURNING became a meditation on a complex and unacknowledged frontier of underground urban intersectional feminism. Combining concert documentation with intimate testimonial interviews, the film is forged from footage of concerts hailed by “Le Monde” as “concert-manifeste transsexuel.”

Enhanced by its raw, lo-fi video aesthetic, TURN IN THE WOUND seeks not to explain or uncover some kind of “objective” truth but to bear witness to and to confront, head on, horrors from which we must not look away."

Mixing documentary-like observation with playful irony, Kidlat Tahimik’s cautionary fable depicts the corrosive effects of capitalism on a tiny Philippine town. It’s there that a family—who make their living producing papier-mâché animals for the religious festival of Turumba—find their lives upended when a German entrepreneur commissions them to produce thousands of figurines for the 1972 Munich Olympics, transforming their humble handicraft business into an increasingly industrial, profit-driven, and alienating enterprise. Told from the point of view of a young boy, TURUMBA uses child’s-eye innocence to issue a barbed takedown of neocolonialist cultural corruption."

Carole Lombard established her genius for screwball comedy with this madcap classic, which practically set the template for the genre. Scripted by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur (adapting their own Broadway play) and directed at breakneck pace by Howard Hawks, TWENTIETH CENTURY unfolds in large part aboard the titular train en route from Chicago to New York. Onboard are Lily Garland (Lombard), a shopgirl turned movie star, and down-on-his-luck Broadway producer Oscar Jaffe (John Barrymore), Lily’s former lover and impresario, who will stop at nothing to convince her to star in his new show. Reunited by fate aboard the speeding locomotive, the pair match wits in a dazzling display of comic firepower."

Starring Hideko Takamine, Shizue Natsukawa, Chishu Ryu

Keisuke Kinoshita’s TWENTY-FOUR EYES (NIJUSHI NO HITOMI) is an elegant, emotional chronicle of a teacher’s unwavering commitment to her students, her profession, and her sense of morality. Set in a remote, rural island community and spanning decades of Japanese history, from 1928 through World War II and beyond, Kinoshita’s film takes a simultaneously sober and sentimental look at the epic themes of aging, war, and death, all from the lovingly intimate perspective of Hisako Oshi (Hideko Takamine), as she watches her pupils grow and deal with life’s harsh realities. Though little known in the United States, TWENTY-FOUR EYES is one of Japan’s most popular and enduring classics."

In the town of Twin Peaks, everybody has their secrets, but no one more than Laura Palmer. In this prequel to his groundbreaking 1990s television series, David Lynch resurrects the teenager found wrapped in plastic at the beginning of the show, following her through the last week of her life and teasing out the enigmas that surround her murder. Homecoming queen by day and drug-addicted thrill seeker by night, Laura leads a double life that pulls her deeper and deeper into horror as she pieces together the identity of the assailant who has been terrorizing her for years. Nightmarish in its vision of an innocent torn apart by unfathomable forces, TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME is nevertheless one of Lynch&#39;s most humane films, aching with compassion for its tortured heroine, a character as enthralling in life as she was in death."

Two English Girls shows François Truffaut working in one of his favorite environments, the work of Henri-Pierre Roche (the author of Jules and Jim), with his longtime leading man/cinematic doppelganger Jean-Pierre Léaud, and telling a story so good on so many levels that he saved the narration for himself. As with many of Truffaut&#39;s best works (of which this is one, though it is often underrated), the story, of the romantic triangle between the two title characters and Léaud&#39;s Claude, is so beautifully delineated that the tale becomes almost secondary to its telling."

Starring Kris Bidenko, Emma Coles, Kris McQuade

This ambitious TV movie by Jane Campion was heralded at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival as the arrival of a major new filmmaking voice. TWO FRIENDS’s screenplay, by renowned Australian novelist Helen Garner, is articulate, assured, and enthralling. The film begins in the present, when teenage friends Louise and Kelly, once inseparable, have already grown apart. Louise is in high school, gets good grades, and has a typical love-hate relationship with her divorced mother. Kelly, in bleached hair and punk gear, lives with friends at the beach and is experimenting with drugs and casual relationships. Campion then takes the film backward in time over the past year in the girls’ friendship. In five episodes, the film reveals the subtle changes that sent the two on their different paths. With the humor, fierce honesty, and passionate sense of humanity that are the hallmarks of Campion’s best work, she tells a story of missed opportunities and minor traumas that take on profound new meanings with the passage of time."

The maverick Hollywood stylist André de Toth sharpened his craft in his native Hungary, including making this chic, dynamic melodrama, studded with deco decor and jazzy musical interludes. Two upwardly mobile working women—one a musician in an all-girl band, the other a bricklayer—join forces in their attempts to make it in Budapest, supporting each other through changing fortunes, the advances of lecherous men, and the highs and heartbreaks of love. Kinetic camera work, brisk editing, and avant-garde imagery abound in this often strikingly modern ode to the power of working-class female solidarity."

Young lawyer Fremissin (Pierre Batcheff) must overcome his debilitating meekness in order to win the hand of the beautiful Cecile (Véra Flory), who has been betrothed against her will to the bestial Garadoux (Jim Gérald), his former legal client. As Fremissin finds the courage to confront his loutish rival, a series of misunderstandings transforms the tense love triangle into a madcap farce, with Clair employing a panoply of devices—such as split screens, reverse motion, and tableaux vivants—to ingenious, hilarious effect. An homage to the slapstick successes of Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd, as well as a final burst of pure visual invention before he switched to sound, TWO TIMID SOULS is Clair at his sweetest and most anarchic."

By the time he made UGETSU, Kenji Mizoguchi was already an elder statesman of Japanese cinema, fiercely revered by Akira Kurosawa and other directors of a younger generation. And with this exquisite ghost story, a fatalistic wartime tragedy derived from stories by Akinari Ueda and Guy de Maupassant, he created a touchstone of his art, his long takes and sweeping camera guiding the viewer through a delirious narrative about two villagers whose pursuit of fame and fortune leads them far astray from their loyal wives. Moving between the terrestrial and the otherworldly, UGETSU reveals essential truths about the ravages of war, the plight of women, and the pride of men.

In this musical melodrama set against the backdrop of a workers’ strike in Nantes, Dominique Sanda plays a young woman who wishes to leave her brutish husband (Michel Piccoli) for an earthy steelworker (Richard Berry), though he is involved with another. Unbeknownst to the girl, the object of her affection boards with her no-nonsense baroness mother (Danielle Darrieux). A late-career triumph from Jacques Demy, UNE CHAMBRE EN VILLE received nine César Award nominations and features a rich, operatic score by Michel Colombier."

As the bumbling investigators (Vladimír Pucholt and Jan Vostrčil) dig into the case, they deduce that not all is as it seems.

Evoking the existential malaise of China’s so-called “birth control” generation—who came of age following the country’s one-child policy—UNKNOWN PLEASURES unfolds in a series of stunning, slow-burn long takes as it traces the relationship between an aimless teenage couple searching for meaning amid the detritus of Western pop culture."

In Saint-Imier in the 1870s, Josephine (Clara Gostynski), a young factory worker, produces the unrest wheel, the ticking heart of the mechanical watch.

With an eclectic soundtrack that gathers a host of the director’s favorite musicians, along with gorgeous cinematography by Robby Müller, this breathless adventure in the shadow of Armageddon takes its heroes to the ends of the earth and into the oneiric depths of their own souls.

Director Shohei Imamura turns this fact-based story—about the seventy-eight-day killing spree of a remorseless man from a devoutly Catholic family—into a cold, perverse, and at times diabolically funny examination of the primitive coexisting with the modern. More than just a true-crime tale, VENGEANCE IS MINE bares humanity’s snarling id."

Starring Ana Beatriz Nogueira, Raul Cortez, Aida Leiner

Based on the tragically short life of Brazilian poet Anderson Bigode Herzer, this intense drama tells the story of Bauer, a trans man who navigates a difficult upbringing in an orphanage before finding love with a young librarian. He has the sympathy of his mentor, a professor who sees his talent as a poet, but struggles to be understood by others: “I’m not what everyone thinks I am. You hear me? I’m different. I’m something else. Something else.” One of the earliest portrayals in cinema of a transmasculine character, VERA features a remarkable lead performance by Ana Beatriz Nogueira, who received the Best Actress prize at the 1987 Berlin Film Festival."

Starring Giuseppe De Domenico, Tommaso Ragno, Martina Scrinzi

Secrets swirl beneath the surface of a remote Italian community in Maura Delpero’s exquisite wartime drama, winner of the Venice Film Festival’s Grand Jury Prize. In a majestic Alpine village touched only faintly by the upheavals of modern life, a strict schoolteacher’s family undergoes a profound shift when a mysterious Sicilian soldier arrives fleeing the front lines of World War II. As the seasons change, the family’s three very different daughters will each find their lives transformed. Blending historically grounded realism with painterly grace, Delpero draws from her own family’s history for an at once intimate and momentous vision of a world suspended between the patriarchal past and the stirrings of a new future."

As their unlikely relationship develops, Robert comes to discover the dark secrets that brought about the decline of Veronika’s career.

She brings fierce charisma and fiery strength to her role as a rumbera—a female nightclub dancer—who gives up everything to raise an abandoned boy, whom she must protect from his ruthless gangster father. Directed at a dizzying pace by filmmaking titan Emilio Fernández, and shot in stylish chiaroscuro by renowned cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa amid smoky dance halls and atmospherically seedy underworld haunts, VICTIMS OF SIN is a ferociously entertaining female-powered noir pulsing with the intoxicating rhythms of some of Latin America’s most legendary musical stars."

Based on stories from Henri Murger’s influential mid-nineteenth-century book “Scènes de la vie de bohème” (the basis for the opera “La bohème”), the film features a marvelous trio of Kaurismäki regulars—André Wilms, Matti Pellonpää, and Karl Väänänen—as a writer, painter, and composer who scrape by together, sharing in life’s daily absurdities.

Blending unflinching realism with moments of startling, light-filled beauty, LA VIE DE JÉSUS finds unexpected philosophical richness in the quotidian, small-town existence of Freddy (nonprofessional David Douche in a revelatory, one-off performance), an aimless young man with epilepsy who, in his childlike simplicity, embodies both great tenderness and terrifying brutality. Leaving the film’s cryptic title tantalizingly open to interpretation, Dumont dares viewers to see the divine in a seemingly dead-end world."

In life, Vincent van Gogh was impoverished, his work largely ignored; today, his paintings are revered as priceless masterpieces. This irony is laid bare in this passionate story of Vincent (an extraordinary Tim Roth), an obsessive artist driven by inexorable demons and his devoted, yet despairing, younger brother, Theo (Paul Rhys), who seems unable to live with him . . . or without him."

A decade after making THE VIRGIN OF PESSAC, Jean Eustache filmed another documentary about his hometown’s annual coronation of a young woman of moral integrity. The differences between the two portraits of the same ritual are subtle yet telling: The selection process is slightly more fraught in the 1970s, as civic leaders are more concerned with the current economic depression than with broader social upheaval. In THE VIRGIN OF PESSAC 79, the ceremony also provides a stage on which progressive changes are made official, with a local order, the Fellows of Pleasant Pessac, inducting their first female member. Finally, the second time around, Eustache employs color photography, an appropriate choice given the event’s verdant spring setting."

As political and social tumult rocked France in May and June of 1968, Jean Eustache used his first documentary to focus on persistent tradition, in the form of a centuries-old ceremony in his hometown of Pessac. Each year, Pessac’s civic leaders choose a young woman they consider an exemplar of moral virtue, with a daylong celebration commemorating the changing of the guard from the previous year’s “virgin” to the present one. Eustache observes the exacting selection process, the fostering of communal bonds, and a bold implication by Pessac’s presiding priest that the ritual upholds the same Christian values for which leftist students and workers were then currently fighting."

In Munich in 1972, eight renowned filmmakers each brought their singular artistry to the spectacle of the Olympic Games, capturing the joy and pain of competition and the kinetic thrill of bodies in motion for an aesthetically adventurous sports film unlike any other. Made to document the Olympic Summer Games—an event that was ultimately overshadowed by the tragedy of a terrorist attack—VISIONS OF EIGHT features contributions from Miloš Forman, Kon Ichikawa, Claude Lelouch, Juri Ozerov, Arthur Penn, Michael Pfleghar, John Schlesinger, and Mai Zetterling, each given carte blanche to create a short film focusing on any aspect of the Games that captured his or her imagination. The resulting films—ranging from the arresting abstraction of Penn’s pure cinema study of pole-vaulters to the playful irreverence of Forman’s musical take on the decathlon to Schlesinger’s haunting portrait of the single-minded solitude of a marathon runner—are triumphs of personal, poetic vision applied to one of the pinnacles of human achievement."

Surrealistic and strange, cast in grainy 16 mm images, VISITATION allows an imaginary glimpse into the aura of “an outer-world night.” The visions in the film are summoned from the filmmaker’s imagining of a mythical eternity that is beautiful but fraught with pain, exposed by the ether voices and figures which inhabit the eternal ballet beneath our consciousness. “My mood at the time had served to aggravate those deeply inhuman and most terrible beings when they came with total abandonment from where they had lurked amongst the stones and wet woods . . .” With these lines, VISITATION unwinds through a hand-painted heavenly hell of unending life and death. Steeped in the alchemical and inner dream life, the film explores a black-and-white landscape of gothic figures who enact evolving metaphysical dramas. Using painted cut-outs and early-cinema techniques (multiple passes, mattes, multi-plane levels, in-camera superimpositions, shutter manipulation, etc.) the film was shot with a 16 mm Bolex camera in black and white, which gives it a grainy, handmade look. The abstract passages were created by placing objects directly onto raw film and exposing the film with a flashlight. Thus the film’s process mirrors the alchemical nature of chemical, material, and metaphysical experimentation."

Two strangers dressed as minstrels (Arletty and Alain Cuny) arrive at a castle in advance of court festivities—and are revealed to be emissaries of the devil, dispatched to spread heartbreak and suffering. Their plans, however, are thwarted by an unexpected intrusion: human love. Often interpreted as an allegory for the Nazi occupation of France, during which it was made, LES VISITEURS DU SOIR—wittily written by Jacques Prévert and Pierre Laroche, and elegantly designed by Alexandre Trauner and shot by Roger Hubert—is a moving tale of love conquering all."

Rakel (Anita Björk) tells of receiving a visit from a former lover (Jarl Kulle); Marta (Maj-Britt Nilsson) of agreeing to marry a painter (Birger Malmsten) only after having his child; and Karin (Eva Dahlbeck) of being stuck with her husband (Gunnar Björnstrand) in an elevator, where they talk intimately for the first time in years. Making dexterous use of flashbacks, the engaging WAITING WOMEN is a veritable seedbed of Ingmar Bergman themes, ranging from aspiring young love to the fear of loneliness, with the finale a masterpiece of chamber comedy."

A young sister (Jenny Agutter) and brother (Luc Roeg) are abandoned in the harsh Australian outback and must learn to cope in the natural world, without their usual comforts, in this hypnotic masterpiece from Nicolas Roeg. Along the way, they meet a young aborigine (David Gulpilil) on his &quot;walkabout,&quot; a rite of passage in which adolescent boys are initiated into manhood by journeying into the wilderness alone.

Ken the Knife, wants to go straight for good girl Yasue but finds that starting over isn&#39;t as simple as it sounds. This was the Japanese master&#39;s first true homage to American crime movies, and it is a fleetly told, expressively shot work of humor and emotional depth."

Based on an incident in the life of director Nico Papatakis’s former friend and collaborator Jean Genet, WALKING A TIGHTROPE casts Michel Piccoli as Marcel Spadice, a thinly veiled version of the celebrated gay writer and provocateur, whose infatuation with an Arab-German circus worker (Lilah Dadi) leads him to try to turn the young man into the world’s greatest tightrope walker. When Marcel begins to pursue a new object of desire, however, his callousness unleashes tragedy."

Directed by Barbara Loden • 1970 • United States
Starring Barbara Loden, Michael Higgins

With her first and only feature film—a hard-luck drama she wrote, directed, and starred in—Barbara Loden turned in a groundbreaking work of American independent cinema, bringing to life a kind of character seldom seen on-screen. Set amid a soot-choked Pennsylvania landscape, and shot in an intensely intimate vérité style, the film takes up with distant and soft-spoken Wanda (Loden), who has left her husband, lost custody of her children, and now finds herself alone, drifting between dingy bars and motels, where she falls prey to a series of callous men—including a bank robber who ropes her into his next criminal scheme. An until now difficult-to-see masterpiece that has nonetheless exerted an outsize influence on generations of artists and filmmakers, WANDA is a compassionate and wrenching portrait of a woman stranded on society’s margins.

With the story of Ryuko’s enmeshment in the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, Tanaka realizes with startling depth her ambition to relate a historical saga from a critical female perspective."

Nevertheless, it was largely dismissed upon its release by critics unable to see the urgency in its evocation of a gritty dystopia in which Black people have been relegated to living in a slum called the Terrordome, where simmering racial tension threatens to boil over in the wake of a young boy’s death. Twenty-five years later, Onwurah’s fusion of political commentary and genre spectacle looks positively prescient, and her ability to build an entire cosmology that connects the history of slavery to present-day police brutality is nothing less than visionary."

This mesmeric parable of societal collapse is an enigma of transcendent visual, philosophical, and mystical resonance. Adapted from a novel by László Krasznahorkai, WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES unfolds in an unknown time in an unnamed village, where, one day, a mysterious circus—complete with an enormous stuffed whale and a shadowy, demagogue-like figure known as the Prince—arrives and appears to awaken a kind of madness in the citizens that builds inexorably toward violence. In thirty-nine hypnotic long takes engraved in ghostly black and white, auteur Béla Tarr and codirector-editor Ágnes Hranitzky conjure an apocalyptic vision of dreamlike dread and fathomless beauty."

G. W. Pabst brought the war movie into a new era with his first sound film, a mercilessly realistic depiction of the nightmare that scarred a generation, in Germany and beyond. Digging into the trenches with four infantrymen stationed in France in the final months of World War I, Pabst illustrates the harrowing ordeals of battle with unprecedented naturalism, as the men are worn away in body and spirit by firefights, shelling, and the disillusion that greets them on the home front. Long unavailable, the newly restored WESTFRONT 1918 is a visceral, sobering antiwar statement that is as urgent today as when it was made."

Starring Robert Liensol, Roland Bertin, Hélène Vincent

Mauritanian French director Med Hondo’s staggering WEST INDIES: THE FUGITIVE SLAVES OF LIBERTY is a sui generis amalgam of historical epic, Broadway revue, Brechtian theater, and joyous agitprop. Using an enormous mock slave ship as the film’s only soundstage, Hondo mounts intricately choreographed reenactments and dance numbers across his multipurpose set to investigate more than three centuries of imperialist oppression. The story traverses the West Indies, Europe, and the Middle Passage; jumps across time to depict the effects of official French policy upon the colonized, the enslaved, and their descendants; and surveys the actions and motivations of the resigned, the revolutionary, and the powers that be (along with their lackeys). No mere extravaganza, WEST INDIES is a call to arms for a spectacular yet critical cinematic reimagining of an entire people’s history of resistance and struggle."

When modern, liberated Setsuko (Michiko Kuwano) visits her meek uncle Komiya (Tatsuo Saito), it’s not long before she sets about meddling in his relationship with his domineering socialite wife (Sumiko Kurishima), turning the gender dynamics in the household upside down.

The immediacy achieved by filming unfolding conflict is juxtaposed with calm observations of the devastating consequences of living one’s life during a state of emergency, creating a lyricism that makes the film much more than just worthy reportage."

When the main event was delayed, extending Ali’s stay in Africa, Gast wound up amassing a treasure trove of footage, observing the wildly charismatic athlete training for one of the toughest bouts of his career while basking in his role as Black America’s proud ambassador to postcolonial Africa.

As our young hero zigzags determinedly across two towns, aided (and sometimes misdirected) by those he encounters, his quest becomes both a revealing portrait of rural Iranian society in all its richness and complexity and a touching parable about the meaning of personal responsibility.

Fully capturing the rugged beauty of its marsh setting, this extraordinarily photographed treasure of children’s cinema—which won the Grand Prix for Best Short Film at the Cannes Film Festival—speaks to the hearts of all creatures yearning to live untamed."

This award-winning documentary deals with the popularization and commercialization of Native American spiritual traditions by non-Indigenous people. Important questions are asked of those seeking to commercially exploit rituals and sacred ceremonies, as well as those vested with safeguarding sacred ways. Incorporating a wide range of voices from Native communities, the film speaks to issues of cultural appropriation with humor, righteous anger, and thoughtful insight."

WHITE VERTIGO is one of the unexpected jewels of this Olympic films collection.

Director Giorgio Ferroni knows how to film the key disciplines, even if they are far removed from his specialties, the sword- and-sandal and pulp fiction genres. The music, by the prolific Angelo Francesco Lavagnino (OTHELLO and CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT), audaciously uses jazz piano to accompany the ice hockey matches, bringing a lyrical mood to a sport that in other Olympic Games documentaries is portrayed in ferocious terms."

Followed for eight years by filmmaker Harrod Blank (son of Les Blank), Rusty guides us through the aftermath of her transition, as growing acceptance among her straight-talking Southwest community still doesn’t ease her romantic and professional woes. Interwoven with lively tales of gender-nonconforming individuals in the art-car community of which Blank is a part, WHY CAN’T I BE ME?

The last of the features Harold Lloyd made with producer Hal Roach, WHY WORRY? succeeds as both a wildly inventive slapstick showcase and an almost surreal satire of American interventionism.

Along the way, though, he forges surprising, unsettling, and enlightening connections with those he meets.

WITHIN OUR GATES is the earliest surviving feature film by an African American director. It was Oscar Micheaux’s second film (after 1919’s THE HOMESTEADER, now lost), centering on an idealistic young woman named Sylvia Landry (Evelyn Preer, one of the first great stars of the race film) who attempts to raise money for an elementary school for black children. In the course of navigating the racial politics of both the black and white communities, Sylvia’s past is revealed in a series of flashbacks that contain the film’s most notorious sequence: the lynching of her parents by a white mob. Micheaux’s staging of the scene is startling in its bluntness and speaks volumes about the director’s fearlessness and willingness to address taboo subject matter. The film touches upon other themes that would recur throughout the controversial filmmaker’s career, such as the promise of rural life vs. the corrupting influence of the city, and the use of religion as a means of misleading the black community."

Starring Paul McGann, Richard E. Grant, Richard Griffiths

The ultimate cult British comedy, Bruce Robinson’s semi-autobiographical cinematic bender is a feast of delectably florid dialogue delivered with deadpan relish by stars Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann as, respectively, Withnail and “I,” a pair of perpetually soused, unemployed actors in 1960s London who, desperate to escape their nightmarishly grimy flat, embark on a hilariously misbegotten country getaway beset by menacing locals, bare cupboards, and a randy uncle—all of which they may be able to withstand as long as they don’t run out of alcohol. While Robinson’s dazzling script yields quotable moments galore, it’s the film’s bittersweet evocation of a friendship gradually unraveling that gives this beloved end-of-youth tale its lasting poignancy."

Věra Chytilová’s subversive take on the 1980s teen-horror movie assembles a gaggle of bratty adolescents for a mysterious skiing retreat at a snowbound cabin where they find themselves plunged into a sadistic social experiment. WOLF’S HOLE is both a gonzo genre joyride and a blistering allegory for the psychic violence wrought by authoritarian oppression."

Fortune teller Agnes Huston (Jean Kent), a.k.a. Madame Astra, has been murdered—but that’s about all anyone can agree on as five different perspectives on the dead woman’s personality come to light during the course of a labyrinthine police investigation. Each suspect remembers her differently. Was Agnes a beautiful, well-bred lady? A slovenly, raging drunk? Can we ever understand the truth of another person’s life? Putting a noir spin on the CITIZEN KANE/RASHOMON–style subjective-flashback structure makes for a delightfully clever and involving whodunnit."

One of the 1960s’ great international art-house sensations, WOMAN IN THE DUNES (SUNA NO ONNA) was for many the grand unveiling of the surreal, idiosyncratic world of Hiroshi Teshigahara. Eiji Okada plays an amateur entomologist who has left Tokyo to study an unclassified species of beetle found in a vast desert. When he misses his bus back to civilization, he is persuaded to spend the night with a young widow (Kyoko Kishida) in her hut at the bottom of a sand dune. What results is one of cinema’s most unnerving and palpably erotic battles of the sexes, as well as a nightmarish depiction of everyday life as a Sisyphean struggle—an achievement that garnered Teshigahara an Academy Award nomination for best director."

When she is convinced to play bait for the killer, two cops are assigned to protect her, one who is a superfan and the other who couldn’t care less about who she is.

With A WOMAN IS A WOMAN, compulsively innovative director Jean-Luc Godard presents “a neorealist musical—that is, a contradiction in terms.” Featuring French superstars Anna Karina, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and Jean-Claude Brialy at their peak of popularity, A WOMAN IS A WOMAN is a sly, playful tribute to—and interrogation of—the American musical comedy, showcasing Godard’s signature wit and intellectual acumen. The film tells the story of exotic dancer Angéla (Karina) as she attempts to have a child with her unwilling lover Émile (Brialy). In the process, she finds herself torn between him and his best friend Alfred (Belmondo). A dizzying compendium of color, humor, and the music of renowned composer Michel Legrand, A WOMAN IS A WOMAN finds the young Godard at his warmest and most accessible, reveling in and scrutinizing the mechanics of his great obsession: the cinema."

Remarkable for its psychological nuance and its boldly modern perspective on an independent woman’s search for fulfillment, Charlie Chaplin’s long-overlooked silent masterpiece A WOMAN OF PARIS is a revelation. Chaplin confounded 1923 audiences with this unexpected foray into serious drama, and by ceding the spotlight to his longtime screen partner Edna Purviance. She is captivating as the vivacious Marie St. Clair, a “woman of fate” who leaves behind her small-minded village for the glamour of Paris, where she finds herself at the center of a Jazz Age whirl of champagne soirees, luxurious pleasure-seeking, romance, and tragedy. Putting aside his Little Tramp persona, Chaplin’s second feature proved that, beyond being a comic genius, he was an artist of immense sensitivity and human understanding."

“Openings”
With examples from 1943 to 2013, from China to Iran, Australia to Finland, we look at how to open a film: from mysterious, direct, floating, foreboding beginnings to plunging straight in. All are instructive in how to create an immediate world. 

“Tone”
What’s the tone of a film—not its story or theme, but what its world feels like? Back to Hollywood and director Dorothy Arzner with MERRILY WE GO TO HELL and its glamorous, amorous mood. This chapter looks at the myriad ways in which directors set the tones of their films: delight, anger, poetry, double tones, moral seriousness, caring, edginess, violence."

“Melodrama”
A genre as popular as comedy, but what are some of the great scenes in melodrama? Sharmila Tagore narrates a story that takes us from the silent American film SHOES to Kira Muratova’s brilliant CHEKHOV’S MOTIFS to Binka Zhelyazkova’s visually remarkable WE WERE YOUNG.

“Sci-Fi”
Our look at sci-fi takes us to unusual places, other realms: Kathryn Bigelow, the Wachowski siblings, Patty Jenkins’s WONDER WOMAN, Lori Petty’s TANK GIRL, and the TV version of Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale.” 

“Horror &amp;amp; Hell”
Literal, figurative, political—in Deepa Mehta’s EARTH, Samira Makhmalbaf’s BLACKBOARDS, Jennifer Kent’s horror masterpiece THE BABADOOK, Joanna Hogg’s squirm-inducing ARCHIPELAGO, the Tunisian film THE SILENCES OF THE PALACE, and more."

Thrillers, and so much more. We look at gripping scenes in films as diverse as Joel DeMott’s documentary DEMON LOVER DIARY, Kathryn Bigelow’s BLUE STEEL, Carol Morley’s DREAMS OF A LIFE, Mimi Leder’s THE PEACEMAKER, and Marleen Gorris’s remarkable A QUESTION OF SILENCE.

“Stasis”
Cinema is an action art, isn’t it? Or is it? Directors Angela Schanelec, Nanouk Leopold, Kira Muratova, Chantal Akerman, Sharon Lockhart, and Sabiha Sumar, among others, show us the pleasures and beauties of the held moment.

“Leave Out”

“Reveal”
How does Lynne Ramsay do a reveal, in MORVEN CALLAR? How does the great actor-director Kinuyo Tanaka? Or Sarah Polley? Or Alice Rohrwacher?

“Memory”
As cinema is a kind of time machine, it’s no surprise that it’s great at representing memory. In this chapter we look at rare movie gems about memory directed by filmmakers including Petra Costa, Maria Plyta, Dorota Kędzierzawska, Věra Chytilová, Mai Zetterling, and Mati Diop.

“Time”
Every filmmaker has to think about time. As this chapter shows, Alice Guy-Blaché, Chantal Akerman, Ildikó Enyedi, Hanna Polak, Marie Menken, and Sally Potter have done so brilliantly."

Novels are great at describing thoughts, but how do films do so? In this chapter, we see how great directors from France, Ukraine, the UK, the U.S., New Zealand, and Algeria have illuminated inner life.

“The Meaning of Life”
In the last chapters of our story, we look at the biggest things in life. Here we see how great filmmakers across the world, and from many decades, try to get to the essence of life.

“Love”
Movies soar with love, but can be too sentimental because of it. In this chapter, we see great Chinese, Sri Lankan, American, Hungarian, Iranian, French, British, Korean, Turkish, and Hong Kong films which avoid the pitfalls."

“Endings”
We begin to end our epic road movie with films from Sonja Heiss, Larisa Shepitko, Ida Lupino, Lizzie Borden, Claire Denis, and Maya Deren.

“Song and Dance”
End with a song, they say, so our story does. Huang Shuqin, Vera Stroyeva, Margaret Tait, Alice Guy-Blaché, Edith Carlmar, Céline Sciamma, Gilda de Abreu, Joan Micklin Silver, Shirley Clarke, Dorothy Arzner, and Beyonce make music with their films.

“Believability”
It’s easy to spot, but not so easy to understand. Believability is about simple human stories, truth about life, real emotions, responding to the world. How do directors create a reality without it feeling fake? True stories can help. But what’s the trick? Here are some answers, drawing from Lois Weber’s THE BLOT and Maren Ade’s TONI ERDMANN.

“Introducing Character”
Going to a house, overhearing people, witnessing bizarre action—there are many ways to meet people and be introduced to characters in films. In Shirley Clarke’s THE CONNECTION, she has a documentary crew introduce the characters to us; Andrea Arnold puts her characters front and center in FISH TANK; and in THE STORY OF THE FLAMING YEARS, directed by Yuliya Solntseva, the main character is presented like a statue on a building.

“Meet Cute”
The classic Hollywood trope of a “meet cute” invites a variety of interpretations, from intimate glimpses to worlds colliding spectacularly. Unique examples include the feverish, pivotal meet cute in Germaine Dulac’s experimental THE SEASHELL AND THE CLERGYMAN, Céline Sciamma playing two girl gangs against each other in GIRLHOOD, and the cynical FBI old guard meeting the idealistic newcomer in Kathryn Bigelow’s POINT BREAK. Then, a masterfully choreographed, layered meet cute in Mania Akbari’s ONE.TWO.ONE is captured in a single wide shot composed like a Renaissance altarpiece."

“Conversation”
A basic human interaction—how to make it cinematic? Angela Schanelec directs us to focus on body language in PLACES IN CITIES, Cecile Tang uses the zoom as guide through the emotional shifts in THE ARCH, and Sofia Coppola in THE VIRGIN SUICIDES shows us an unspoken conversation, with songs and split screens telling a story of impossible longing.

“Framing”
Frames describe and paint the scenes. They can make sport look balletic, like in controversial Nazi iconographer’s Leni Riefenstahl’s OLYMPIA. They shape the cinematic world—through impressionist glances in Kathryn Bigelow’s BLUE STEEL, suffocating close-ups in Lucrecia Martel’s THE HOLY GIRL, and camera angles as extreme as the titular character’s emotions in Mahalia Belo’s ELLEN.

“Tracking”
Tracking shots are to many an essence of filmmaking magic. They can ask questions and speak when hardly anyone else in the film is talking—like in Chantal Akerman’s FROM THE EAST or Marion Hänsel’s LE LIT. In Antonia Bird’s FACE, a seamless tracking shot gives us an illusion of the camera being an extension of our eyes. Kinetic in nature, tracking can help dynamically show and express a desperate escape, like in Ursula Meier’s HOME."

“Staging”
Scene staging is an element of film form pointing clearly to cinema’s origin: theater. Kinuyo Tanaka uses staging in THE MOON HAS RISEN to shape the scene’s invisible geometry, accentuating the tension between characters. Maren Ade stages through depth in TONI ERDMANN, facilitating the tragicomic punch line. And in Maria Schrader’s STEFAN ZWEIG: FAREWELL TO EUROPE, the crisscrossing staging in the final scene makes its location come alive.

“Journey”
Movement is key to a motion picture, and journeys in film can be horizontal as well as vertical (into the self). Travel can be like glue and bind characters from two different worlds, like when a middle-class woman and working-class man go on a moral journey against society in KRANE’S CONFECTIONERY. Driving can be a test of will and courage, like in Nell Shipman’s SOMETHING NEW. A mode of transportation can serve as a safe space and a social microcosm, like the car in Andrea Arnold’s AMERICAN HONEY. Or, like in Jennifer Kent’s THE BABADOOK, it can take the character on a journey into her nightmares.

“Discovery”
Discovery and revelation shape some of cinema’s most iconic moments. But beyond the best-known scenes, there lies the humanity, craft, and insight of discovery—like in Céline Sciamma’s TOMBOY, when the mother suddenly sees her child in a new light. There’s the discovery of the opposite sex’s naked form, like in the male-gaze-flipping scene from Patty Jenkins’s WONDER  WOMAN. Then, in Sabiha Sumar’s SILENT WATERS, the audience is guided through a discovery that changes everything about how they view the story."

“Adult/Child”
Most famous movie genres—war pictures, westerns, etc.—are about adults, but in this chapter, Jane Fonda narrates the story of eighteen films about children, from Germany, Belgium, Mongolia, Sweden, Russia, Canada, Senegal, Argentina, and Scotland.

“Economy”
We’ve all seen overblown films, but what are the visual and story lessons we can learn from Claire Denis, Maria Louisa Bemberg, Kinuyo Tanaka, Agnès Varda, Valeska Grisebach, and Desiree Akhavan about keeping things simple?

“Editing”
How have filmmakers like Ava Du Vernay, Kathryn Bigelow, Sarah Maldoror, Leni Riefentahl, and Drahoméra Vihanová and their editors pushed the techniques of editing to their limits?"

Is cinema the art of point of view? Jocelyn Moorhouse, Ida Lupino, Edith Carlmar, Sofia Coppola, Liliana Cavani, Kelly Reichardt, Larisa Shepitko, Jennifer Kent, and other great directors demonstrate the art of POV.

“Close-Up”
Films from Belgium, Hungary, Australia, Finland, China, the United States, France, Germany and Ukraine, shot over ten decades, show how close-ups create intensity.

“Dream”

Bodies in cinema can be enticing, athletic, or brutalized. Jane Fonda narrates this chapter about how some of the great directors—including Agnès Varda, Andrea Arnold, Marva Nabili, Pirjo Honkasalo, Márta Mészáros, and Wanda Jakubowska—have filmed bodies.

“Sex”
From bodies to sex—one of the most controversial aspects of film. In this chapter Diane Kurys, Lucile Hadžihalilović, Jamie Babbit, Safi Faye, Athina Rachel Tsangari, Alison de Vere, Carine Adler, Donna Deitch, Miranda July, Lucía Puenzo, Maren Ade, Chantal Akerman, and others show a variety of ways of showing sex on screen."

“Home”
Refuge, shelter, or prison? Sharmila Tagore narrates the story of home on-screen in the great films of Edith Carlmar, Lynne Ramsay, Mai Zetterling, Liu Jiayin, Forough Farrokhzad, Antonia Bird, and others.

“Religion”
Narrator Sharmila Tagore takes us on a global tour of great films about religion. We start in the U.S. in the 1910s, go to Sri Lanka in the ’70s, and dip into the work of Lucrecia Martel, Jessica Hausner, and Marjane Satrapi.

“Work”
Work seems too unglamorous for cinema, but as narrator Jane Fonda tells us, in films like AMERICAN HONEY, the silent Russian masterpiece WOMEN OF RYAZAN, Venezuela’s ARAYA, Patty Jenkins’s MONSTER, and Mary Harron’s AMERICAN PSYCHO, some of the most engrossing scenes show work."

“Politics”
Another aspect of everyday life. From silent cinema to the twenty-first century, movies from the visually astonishing THE ENCHANTED DESNA to DIVORCE IRANIAN STYLE to STRANGE DAYS have gained their energy and attack from their politics.

“Gear Change”
We like to be taken by surprise in films. This short chapter, narrated by Sharmila Tagore, looks at such surprises.

“Comedy”

In the lush backwoods of Mississippi and Alabama, history is being made. Poor Black and white working people are trying to overcome the forces of racism to organize into cooperative associations and dispel the bonds of their economic captors—the paper and pulpwood companies. In his final feature-length work, director Lionel Rogosin allows his subjects to tell and live their own story. We see them in their homes, with their families, and in the forests, which provide them the things that make them woodcutters: trees and freedom. Interviews with the men directly involved in the formation of the group—the Gulf-Coast Pulpwood Association—reveal the intricacies of this venture, an inspiring depiction of unity among workers across racial lines."

Using a masterful arsenal of film techniques, from haunting matte paintings to jarring documentary-like camerawork in the film&#39;s battle sequences, Bernard created a pacifist work of enormous empathy and chilling despair.

More than forty years ago, in 1978, WORD IS OUT: STORIES OF SOME OF OUR LIVES startled audiences across the country when it appeared in movie theaters and on television. The first feature-length documentary about queer identity made by gay filmmakers, the film was created by the Mariposa Film Group, a collective comprised of three lesbians (Veronica Selver, Lucy Massie Phenix, Nancy Adair) and three gay men (Rob Epstein, Peter Adair, Andrew Brown). Featuring candid interviews with twenty-six gay men and women across a wide range of demographics, it became an immediate flash point in the emerging gay-rights movement of the 1970s and forever altered the cultural conversation around LGBT issues."

Sex work is portrayed with radical nonjudgment in Lizzie Borden’s immersive, richly detailed look at the rhythms and rituals of society’s most stigmatized profession. Inspired by the experiences of the sex workers Borden met while making her underground feminist landmark BORN IN FLAMES, WORKING GIRLS reveals the textures of a day in the life of Molly (Louise Smith), a photographer working part-time in a Manhattan brothel, as she juggles a steady stream of clients, balances nurturing relationships with her coworkers with the demands of an ambitious madam, and above all fights to maintain her sense of self in a business in which the line between the personal and the professional is all too easily blurred. In viewing prostitution through the lens of labor, Borden boldly desensationalizes the subject, offering an empathetic, humanizing, often humorous depiction of women for whom this work is just another day at the office."

Shooting amid the harsh conditions of volcanic sulfur mines in Indonesia, a ship-breaking yard in Pakistan, a Nigerian butcher’s market, a Chinese steel mill, and beyond, Glawogger captures images of overwhelming, sometimes almost apocalyptic power set to an entrancing score by John Zorn."

Written and directed by the artists, THE WORLD OF GILBERT &amp;amp; GEORGE is both their singular self-portrait and a subversive personal tour through Thatcher-era Britain, where church spires and city streets, youths and drunks, dancing and tea drinking all take on affecting new meanings when viewed from their unique perspective."

Timothy Carey—the unforgettable character actor whose weird, wiggy energy brought a manic edge to classics like THE KILLING and PATHS OF GLORY—wrote, produced, directed, and starred in this outrageous underground satire of all-American demagoguery, one of the great gonzo cult films of all time. He plays insurance salesman Clarence Hilliard, who, disenchanted with his ordinary life, transforms himself into a self-styled evangelist, declares himself God, and—using rock ’n’ roll and sex—builds a cultlike following that propels him up the political ladder. But first he’ll have to face the wrath of the real God. With a singularly crazed performance from Carey, unhinged camerawork, and a soundtrack by a young Frank Zappa, THE WORLD’S GREATEST SINNER is a truly independent, one-of-a-kind expression of its creator’s warped genius.

After seeking a cure from a local marabout, El Hadji must face the possibility that he deserves the infliction for his part in embezzling public funds and for helping to keep Senegal under French control.

This galvanizing documentary tells the story of individuals who have dared to change the world for the better, and of Tennessee’s world-renowned Highlander Folk School (now Highlander Research and Education Center), the place that for over ninety years has taught them how to achieve this change. Whether fighting for civil rights, labor reform, or stopping the ravaging of communities by strip mining and toxic-waste dumping, the Highlander community has been active in some of the most significant American social movements of the last century. Rich in the language and music of the South, YOU GOT TO MOVE is about people’s discovery within themselves of the courage and ability to confront reality and change it."

Starring Derrick De Marney, Nova Pilbeam, Percy Marmont

Alfred Hitchcock’s delightfully entertaining, often overlooked tale of a wrongly accused man follows a young writer (Derrick De Marney) who, when he becomes the prime suspect in the murder of an actress, goes on the run with the chief constable’s daughter (Nova Pilbeam) as his only help. Romance and thrills ensue, with Hitchcock’s master touch apparent in a memorable children’s-party set piece and an elaborately choreographed crane shot used to reveal the killer.

Please be advised: this film contains a sequence involving blackface."

Starring Catherine Deneuve, Françoise Dorléac

Jacques Demy followed up THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG with another musical about missed connections and second chances, this one a more effervescent confection. Twins Delphine and Solange, a dance instructor and a music teacher (played by real-life sisters Catherine Deneuve and Françoise Dorléac), long for big-city life; when a fair comes through their quiet port town, so does the possibility of escape. With its jazzy Michel Legrand score, pastel paradise of costumes, and divine supporting cast (George Chakiris, Grover Dale, Danielle Darrieux, Michel Piccoli, and Gene Kelly), THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT is a tribute to Hollywood optimism from sixties French cinema’s preeminent dreamer."

Jackie Chan’s second directorial effort was also a film of important firsts: his first for upstart studio Golden Harvest and his first with cowriter Edward Tang, who would become a key collaborator. The star-filmmaker shows his increasing confidence with this endlessly inventive tale of a martial-arts student (Chan) who goes in search of his exiled brother, only to become entangled in a case of mistaken identity—with much amusement provided by Chan’s interplay with his real-life former schoolmate Yuen Biao. The epic finale, in which Chan goes from human punching bag to raging bull, is a bruising highlight of his career."

From the moment Parliament’s “P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)” erupts over the opening of Isaac Julien’s breakthrough feature, we know we’re in for a wild ride. The changes keep coming as a murder sets off a police investigation and waves of controversy in London’s Black community. The year is 1977, and while some people are busy getting ready to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s Silver Jubilee, others have more important things on their minds. Punks and Teds, National Front and Natty Dreads are fighting in the streets, and the authorities seem more interested in harassing the victim’s friends than in solving the crime. A riveting look at the forces of race, class, and sex that reshaped the UK just before the Thatcher years, YOUNG SOUL REBELS, which won the 1991 Critics’ Week Prize at Cannes, remains as exciting and vital today as ever."

This Academy Award winner—loosely based on the 1963 assassination of Greek left-wing activist Gregoris Lambrakis—stars Yves Montand as a prominent politician and doctor whose public murder amid a violent demonstration is covered up by military and government officials; Jean-Louis Trintignant is the tenacious magistrate who’s determined not to let them get away with it.

This is the first entry to scrutinize the swordsman’s methods, as a blind monk confronts Zatoichi about his violent approach to problem solving and Zatoichi finds the child turning to the same bloodstained path."

Starring Catherine Demongeot, Philippe Noiret

A brash and precocious ten-year-old (Catherine Demongeot) comes to Paris for a whirlwind weekend with her rakish uncle (Philippe Noiret); he and the viewer get more than they bargained for, however, in this anarchic comedy from Louis Malle, which rides roughshod over the City of Light. Based on a popular novel by Raymond Queneau that had been considered unadaptable, Malle’s audacious ZAZIE DANS LE MÉTRO (“Zazie in the Metro”), made with flair on the cusp of the French New Wave, is a bit of stream-of-consciousness slapstick, wall-to-wall with visual gags, editing tricks, and effects."

Starring Jean Dasté, Gérard de Bédarieux, Louis Lefebvre

So effervescent and charming that one can easily forget its importance in film history, Jean Vigo’s enormously influential portrait of prankish boarding-school students is one of cinema’s great acts of rebellion. Based on the director’s own experiences as a youth, ZÉRO DE CONDUITE presents childhood as a time of unfettered imagination and brazen rule-flouting. It’s a sweet-natured vision of sabotage made vivid by dynamic visual experiments—including the famous, blissful slow-motion pillow fight."

A deep dive into the Serbian-American communities of California and Chicago, this typically affectionate documentary from Les Blank explores the historical forces that first brought Serbian settlers to the New World, where they forged a lasting sense of cultural identity that lives on among their descendants. Food, folklore, music, dance, and religion are all part of a rich cultural heritage that Blank captures with a warmth and lived-in intimacy as only he can."

Shot in rural French-speaking Louisiana, this vibrant ethnographic portrait of zydeco’s beloved musical families explores their Creole identities through engaging footage of them at home, in local clubs, at work, and running Mardi Gras. Featuring performances and interviews with musicians like the Carrière Brothers, Alphonse “Bois Sec” Ardoin, John Delafose, and Delton Broussard, ZYDECO is an invaluable record of a vital and increasingly marginalized musical tradition that fuses elements of Cajun, Caribbean, and blues styles into foot-stomping joy."
