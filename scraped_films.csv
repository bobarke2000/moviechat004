Starring Marina Vlady, Anny Duperey, Joseph Gerhard

In 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER (2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D’ELLE), Jean-Luc Godard beckons us ever closer, whispering in our ears as narrator. About what? Money, sex, fashion, the city, love, language, war: in a word, everything. Among the legendary French filmmaker’s finest achievements, the film takes as its ostensible subject the daily life of Juliette Janson (Marina Vlady), a housewife from the Paris suburbs who prostitutes herself for extra money. Yet this is only a template for Godard to spin off into provocative philosophical tangents and gorgeous images. 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER is perhaps Godard’s most revelatory look at consumer culture, shot in ravishing widescreen color by Raoul Coutard."

Starring Jasmine Thiré, Michel Jeannès, Jacky Patin

A billowing pink dress launches a stouthearted teenage girl on a time- and space-collapsing odyssey from her humble goat farm to the big city and beyond in this playfully meandering feminist fantasia from Agnès Varda. Commissioned by Italian high-fashion house Miu Miu and shot in part on Varda’s beloved Parisian home street, rue Daguerre, LES 3 BOUTONS slyly juxtaposes the ancient and the modern, the pastoral and the urban, the real and the imaginary to create a fairy tale rooted not in passive wish fulfillment but in spirited self-empowerment."

They stay in touch, but eventually drift apart with school and new friends to distract them. As the seasons pass, Takaki navigates his relationships while haunted by all the things he left unsaid with Akari, his first love."

Director Tancred Ibsen&#39;s penchant for depicting rustic life shines through in the bucolic scenes at the start of THE VI OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES, OSLO 1952. In addition to the exciting scenes of competition (Winter sports are followed with almost rabid fervor in Scandinavia), Ibsen records a sense of community spirit shared among the competitors."

Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, a director whose new project is collapsing around him, along with his life. One of the greatest films about film ever made, Federico Fellini’s 8½ (Otto e mezzo) turns one man’s artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema.

Constructed around eight dramatic interviews, punctuated by snippets of pop songs and poetry, along with beautifully shot footage of the demolition, 24 CITY attempts to understand the complexity of the social changes sweeping across China by exploring both the factory’s physical destruction and its powerful symbolic echo of a half century of Communist rule."

For what would prove to be his final film, Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami gave himself a challenge: to create a dialogue between his work as a filmmaker and his work as a photographer, bridging the two art forms to which he had dedicated his life. Setting out to reconstruct the moments immediately before and after a photograph is taken, Kiarostami selected twenty-four still images—most of them stark landscapes inhabited only by foraging birds and other wildlife—and digitally animated each one into its own subtly evolving four-and-a-half-minute vignette, creating a series of poignant studies in movement, perception, and time. A sustained meditation on the process of image making, 24 FRAMES is a graceful and elegiac farewell from one of the giants of world cinema."

Delphine Zentout plays Lili, a precocious fourteen-year-old girl on a seaside family vacation. Drawn to a bitter middle-aged man (Étienne Chicot), Lili longs to lose her virginity and initiates a contest of wills in which she discovers herself more mature than, but still rattled by the equivocations of, her chauvinistic counterpart. Fueled by an extraordinary performance by then-sixteen-year-old Zentout, and featuring a scene-stealing Jean-Pierre Léaud as Lili’s brief confidant, 36 FILLETTE showcases Breillat as an incisive chronicler of the subtle evolutions of teenage desire."

Director Andrew Haigh carries the tradition of British realist cinema to artful new heights in 45 YEARS, weaving the momentous into the mundane as the pair go about their daily lives, while the evocatively flat, wintry Norfolk landscape frames their struggle to maintain an increasingly untenable status quo. Loosely adapting a short story by David Constantine, Haigh shifts the focus from the slightly erratic Geoff to Kate, eliciting a remarkable, nuanced portrayal by Rampling of a woman’s gradual metamorphosis from unflappable wife to woman undone."

At once a compelling piece of anti-isolationist propaganda and a quick-witted wartime thriller, 49TH PARALLEL is a classic early work from the inimitable British filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. When a Nazi U-boat crew, headed by the ruthless Eric Portman, is stranded in Canada during the thick of World War II, the men evade capture by hiding out in a series of rural communities, before trying to cross the border into the still-neutral United States. Both soul-stirring and delightfully entertaining, 49TH PARALLEL features a colorful cast of characters played by larger-than-life actors Laurence Olivier, Raymond Massey, Anton Walbrook, and Leslie Howard."

Seventy-one intricate, puzzlelike scenes survey the routines of a handful of seemingly unrelated people—including an undocumented Romanian boy living on the streets of Vienna, a couple who are desperate to adopt a child, and a college student on the edge—whose stories collide in a devastating encounter at a bank. The omnipresent drone of television news broadcasts in 71 FRAGMENTS OF A CHRONOLOGY OF CHANCE underscores Haneke’s vision of a numb, dehumanizing world in which emotional estrangement can be punctured only by the shock of sudden violence."

Abigail’s mother, Sue (Harriet Reynolds), is invited to take refuge from her teenage daughter’s party by a neighboring couple, Beverly (Alison Steadman) and Laurence (Tim Stern).

Starring Deniz Celiloğlu, Merve Dizdar, Musab Ekici

Nestled away in wintry East Anatolia, public-school art teacher Samet (Deniz Celiloğlu) yearns to leave the sleepy village for cosmopolitan Istanbul. Further disenchanted when he and Kenan (Musab Ekici), a colleague, come under public scrutiny, Samet fears circumstances will keep him in Anatolia and his dreams of a new life permanently out of reach. A silver lining is a budding relationship with Nuray (Merve Dizdar), a fellow teacher and firebrand who develops connections with both Samet and Kenan, forcing Samet to confront what he can&#39;t readily accept. Renowned for his nuanced, visually ravishing imagery, award-winning director Nuri Bilge Ceylan (ONCE UPON A TIME IN ANATOLIA, WINTER SLEEP) capstones the film with one of his greatest sequences, a dazzling metacinematic climax featuring an entrancing performance from Dizdar, who took home Best Actress at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

ABOUT TAP features performances by and recollections from three of America’s leading male tap dancers: Steve Condos, Jimmy Slyde, and Chuck Green. Condos thinks of himself as an instrumentalist who focuses on the ankles and feet; Jimmy Slyde talks of “visual dancers” who “all make pictures”; and Chuck Green advises using the balletic port de bras technique.

The sharply written and impeccably performed AFTER THE REHEARSAL, originally made for television, pares away all artifice to examine both the allure and the cost of a life in the theater."

Eisenstein drew on history, Russian folk narratives, and the techniques of Walt Disney to create this broadly painted epic of Russian resilience. This story of Teutonic knights vanquished by Prince Alexander Nevsky’s tactical brilliance resonated deeply with a Soviet Union concerned with the rise of Nazi Germany. Widely imitated, most notably by Laurence Olivier’s Battle of Agincourt re-creation for HENRY V, the Battle on the Ice scene remains one of the most famous audio-visual experiments in film history, perfectly blending action with the rousing score of Sergei Prokofiev."

Working with some of Egypt’s biggest stars of the time and deftly balancing a dizzying array of subplots—including a queer romance—Chahine creates a deeply personal tapestry of art, politics, culture, and community at a transformative moment in Egyptian history."

ALEXIA is an experimental video about word-blindness and metaphor. Word-blindness is a condition that usually afflicts people who have suffered a stroke, causing them to lose the visual recognition of individual letters but perceive the entire word, or vice versa. Metaphor is here discussed in its function to reveal and obscure perception. Divided into five short sections, ALEXIA opens with a quote from a well-known Buddhist passage (“Do not mistake the finger for the moon”) and goes on to present Giambattista Vico’s theory of the origin of language and Ludwig Wittgenstein’s theory of aspect-blindness."

A German journalist (Rüdiger Vogler) is driving across the United States to research an article; it’s a disappointing trip, in which he is unable to truly connect with what he sees. Things change, however, when he has no choice but to take a young girl named Alice (Yella Rottländer) with him on his return trip to Germany, after her mother (Lisa Kreuzer)—whom he has just met—leaves the child in his care.

A lonely widow (Brigitte Mira) meets a much younger Arab worker (El Hedi ben Salem) in a bar during a rainstorm.

In a room, a young woman (Alix Cléo Roubaud) describes to a young man (Boris Eustache, the director’s son) the stories, techniques, and meanings behind several of her meticulously composed black-and-white photographs.

Grief-stricken, she sets out to search for the boy’s long-lost father in Barcelona, where she reawakens into a new maternal role, at the head of a surrogate family that includes a pregnant, HIV-positive nun (Penélope Cruz); an illustrious star of the stage (Marisa Paredes); and a transgender sex worker (Antonia San Juan).

Vojtěch Jasný won the best director award at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for this sweeping portrait of a small Czech village between the years of 1945 and 1958, during which the residents go from hopeful in the aftermath of the defeat of the Nazis to increasingly demoralized in the face of the Communist takeover. Lyrical in its feeling for landscape but biting in its social and political commentary, ALL MY GOOD COUNTRYMEN stands as the defining work by one of the lesser-known figures of the Czechoslovak New Wave."

What happens to a lifetime of love when it collides with the harsh realities of a bureaucratic system that doesn’t recognize your relationship? That’s the question at the heart of this profoundly poignant, delicate exploration of the meaning of family, in which Angie (Patra Au Ga-man), a sixtysomething lesbian living in Hong Kong, finds herself adrift following the sudden death of Pat (Maggie Li Lin-lin), her loving partner of forty years. When she learns that, because they were unable to legally marry, Pat’s estate will pass to her extended family, Angie struggles to retain both her dignity and the home that they shared for over thirty years."

After suffering the loss of a child, a woman joins a Satanic cult with the hope of ridding herself of nightmarish dreams—but rather than easing her trauma, she soon finds her darkest, most disturbing fears coming to life. Featuring a striking performance from Edwige Fenech and directed by often-overlooked giallo master Sergio Martino, ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK (a.k.a.

Payal Kapadia’s acclaimed fiction-feature debut is a radiant ode to hope-giving connections forged amid big-city anonymity. Set against the hypnotic luminescence of Mumbai, ALL WE IMAGINE AS LIGHT follows three very different women working at the same hospital—Prabha (Kani Kusruti), Anu (Divya Prabha), and Parvathy (Chhaya Kadam)—each contending with personal and material struggles amid a modernizing India riven by gentrification and rising Hindu nationalism. When eviction drives Parvathy back to her childhood village, the trio embark on an enchanting getaway by the sea, where they shake loose their remaining secrets and—in one otherworldly sequence—a lingering ghost. Winner of the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, ALL WE IMAGINE AS LIGHT is a deep-rooted study of the fortifying power of friendship, propelled by moving performances and the director’s compassionate eye.

A rediscovered treasure of independent cinema, this incisive comedic drama follows Rainbow Gold (Victoria Gabrielle Platt), a teenager coming of age in Brooklyn, as she looks to two vastly different models of womanhood: her straitlaced mother, Alma (Kim Weston-Moran), who runs a hair salon in the parlor of their home and disapproves of her daughter’s newfound interest in boys; and her free-spirited, larger-than-life aunt Ruby (Mizan Kirby), who has just returned from Paris after a ten-year absence and whose presence shakes up the household.

Sumptuous, deliciously irreverent, and graced with immortal music, Miloš Forman’s marvelous adaptation of Peter Shaffer’s play returns in a new restoration. One of the great cultural events of the 1980s, this lavish saga of genius, rivalry, and treachery was not only a critical triumph but a box-office hit, garnering eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Director. From a nineteenth-century insane asylum, aged composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham, delectably diabolical) recalls the events of three decades earlier, when the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce, memorably giddy, giggling) first gains favor in the court of Austria’s Emperor Joseph II. Salieri rues the fact that his own music never rises above mediocrity, and he remains permanently incensed that God would bless so vulgar and obnoxious a young whippersnapper as Mozart with divine genius. Unable to match Mozart’s talent, Salieri devises a duplicitous scheme that will be the downfall of them both."

Born into an upper-class family with a doting mother who foots the bill for her indolent lifestyle, combative twenty-four-year-old Amanda (the magnetic Benedetta Porcaroli) searches for boyfriends but only finds misfits who are repelled by her intensity.

Starring Eleonora Rossi Drago, Gabriele Ferzetti, Franco Fabrizi

This major early achievement by Michelangelo Antonioni bears the first signs of the cinema-changing style for which he would soon be world-famous. LE AMICHE (THE GIRLFRIENDS) is a brilliantly observed, fragmentary depiction of modern bourgeois life, conveyed from the perspective of five Turinese women. As four of the friends try to make sense of the suicide attempt of the fifth, they find themselves examining their own troubled romantic lives. With suggestions of the theme of modern alienation and the fastidious visual abstraction that would define his later masterpieces such as L’AVVENTURA, L’ECLISSE, and RED DESERT, Antonioni’s film is a devastating take on doomed love and fraught friendship.

In many ways a breakthrough work for director Jacques Rivette (and a thematic precursor to his legendary OUT 1, released two years later), this epic portrait of a relationship in breakdown found the French New Wave’s most uncompromising auteur pushing the conventions of cinema to their limit to explore his trademark obsessions with the boundaries between performance and reality, stage and cinema, structure and improvisation, and the modern and the mythic. Amid rehearsals for a televised production of Racine’s “Andromaque,” an actor (Bulle Ogier) and theater director (Jean-Pierre Kalfon) see their marriage implode, a situation that grows increasingly volatile when he replaces her with his mistress."

Thus ensues ANATOMY OF HELL, one of the most controversial films of Catherine Breillat’s career—a singularly daring meditation on the pleasures and horrors of the flesh. Buoyed by the two leads’ fearless performances, HELL is as much a philosophical treatise on the hidden traumas of sexuality as it is an increasingly unsettling battle of the sexes, with Breillat using a hushed chamber-play setup to show the spectator no quarter throughout the transgressive proceedings. The result is like nothing else, even within the director’s audacious oeuvre: her deepest expression of anguish over the unspeakable ecstasies and degradations of the body erotic."

In the aftermath of the 1990 earthquake in Iran that left fifty thousand dead, Abbas Kiarostami returned to Koker, where his camera surveys not only devastation but also the teeming life in its wake. Blending fiction and reality into a playful, poignant road movie, AND LIFE GOES ON follows a film director who, along with his son, makes the trek to the region in hopes of finding out if the young boys who acted in WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE? are among the survivors, and discovers a resilient community pressing on in the face of tragedy. Finding beauty in the bleakest of circumstances, Kiarostami crafts a quietly majestic ode to the best of the human spirit."

AND NOW MIGUEL is known today as the beloved novel by Joseph Krumgold that won the Newberry Medal for excellence in American children’s literature in 1954. But few know that the story actually originated as a motion picture for the U.S. State Department directed by Krumgold. Miguel Chavez is the twelve-year-old son of a family of shepherds who dreams of joining the older men in his family as they take their flock of sheep out to pasture in New Mexico’s Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Small but determined, Miguel sets out to prove to his family that he is ready to take his place as a shepherd. Magnificently photographed with an emphasis on local customs and practices, this beautifully observed quasi-documentary is an essential record of Latino life in a remote corner of 1950s America."

Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky • 1966 • Soviet Union
Starring Anatoly Solonitsyn, Ivan Lapikov, Nikolai Grinko

Tracing the life of a renowned icon painter, the second feature by Andrei Tarkovsky vividly conjures the murky world of medieval Russia. This dreamlike and remarkably tactile film follows Andrei Rublev as he passes through a series of poetically linked scenes—snow falls inside an unfinished church, naked pagans stream through a thicket during a torchlit ritual, a boy oversees the clearing away of muddy earth for the forging of a gigantic bell—gradually emerging as a man struggling mightily to preserve his creative and religious integrity. Appearing here in the director’s preferred 183-minute cut as well as the version that was originally suppressed by Soviet authorities, the masterwork ANDREI RUBLEV is one of Tarkovsky’s most revered films, an arresting meditation on art, faith, and endurance."

George Bernard Shaw&#39;s breezy, delightful dramatization of this classic fable, about a Christian slave who pulls a thorn from a lion&#39;s paw and is spared from death in the Colosseum as a result of his kind act, was written as a meditation on modern Christian values. And Pascal&#39;s final Shaw production plays it broadly, casting comic character actor Alan Young as the titular naïf.

Legendary Beat visionary Bob Kaufman considered poetry a key to human survival, an idea made all the more legitimate by the longevity it is granted: the things he saw, heard, tasted, felt, and, most of all, thought were preserved in his work. Embodying the spirit of those efforts, director Billy Woodberry’s first feature since his 1983 LA Rebellion landmark BLESS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS is perhaps the closest we can come to knowing the man and his time. Both dense and nimble in its assemblage of archival footage and photos, interviews with contemporaries, and readings from the likes of Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, AND WHEN I DIE looks back at a familiar era with new eyes, thanks in no small part to the honest assessment provided by many figures of New York’s Beat generation some half-century removed."

APARAJITO picks up where the first film leaves off, with Apu and his family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy city of Varanasi (then known as Benares). As Apu progresses from wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager, eventually studying in Kolkata, we witness his academic and moral education, as well as the growing complexity of his relationship with his mother. This tenderly expressive, often heart-wrenching film, which won three top prizes at the Venice Film Festival, including the Golden Lion, not only extends but also spiritually deepens the tale of Apu."

For APART FROM YOU, Mikio Naruse turned his camera on the lives of working women, which he would continue to do throughout his long career. In this gently devastating drama, a critical breakthrough for the director, he contrasts the life of an aging geisha, whose angry teenage son is ashamed of her profession, with that of her youthful counterpart, a lovely young girl resentful of her family for forcing her into a life of ignominy."

Director Axelle Ropert puts a fresh spin on the 1930s-style screwball comedy with this charmingly literal take on the old adage that “love is blind.” Demand is low for rebetiko (Greek folk music) in Paris, but that doesn’t stop the Papagika brothers. Elise (Mélanie Bernier), who lives in their building, shares a passion for music with Théo Papagika (Bastien Bouillon), but when they first meet in the elevator, he doesn’t notice that she is blind.

By the time APUR SANSAR was released, Satyajit Ray had directed not only the first two Apu films but also the masterpiece THE MUSIC ROOM, and was well on his way to becoming a legend. This extraordinary final chapter brings our protagonist’s journey full circle. Apu is now in his early twenties, out of college, and hoping to live as a writer. Alongside his professional ambitions, the film charts his romantic awakening, which occurs as the result of a most unlikely turn of events, and his eventual, fraught fatherhood. Featuring soon to be Ray regulars Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in star-making performances, and demonstrating Ray’s ever more impressive skills as a crafter of pure cinematic imagery, APUR SANSAR is a moving conclusion to this monumental trilogy."

Transposing a Tolstoy novella to contemporary Paris, L’ARGENT follows a counterfeit bill as it originates as a prop in a schoolboy prank, then circulates like a virus among the corrupt and the virtuous alike before landing with a young truck driver and leading him to incarceration and violence. With brutal economy, Bresson constructs his unforgiving vision of original sin out of starkly perceived details, rooting his characters in a dehumanizing material world that withholds any hope of transcendence."

In the darkest days of World War II, two partisans set out for supplies to sustain their beleaguered outfit, braving the blizzard-swept landscape of Nazi-occupied Belorussia. When they fall into the hands of German forces and come face-to-face with death, each must choose between martyrdom and betrayal, in a spiritual ordeal that lifts the film’s earthy drama to the plane of religious allegory.

In a small Polish town on the final day of World War II, Maciek (the coolly charismatic Zbigniew Cybulski), a fighter in the underground anti-Communist resistance movement, has orders to assassinate an incoming commissar. But when he meets and falls for a young barmaid (Ewa Krzyżewska), he begins to question his commitment to a cause that requires him to risk his life.

After thirteen years of exile, she is returned to the land of her birth as an exceptional assassin, with orders to kill her husband-to-be (Chang Chen). Now, she must confront her parents, her memories, and her long-repressed feelings and choose whether to sacrifice the man she loves or break forever with the sacred way of the righteous assassins.

Marrying the pulp pleasures of the gritty Hong Kong action drama with hints of the head-rush romanticism Wong would push to intoxicating heights throughout the 1990s, AS TEARS GO BY was a box office smash that heralded the arrival of one of contemporary cinema’s most electrifying talents."

Both a surprisingly erotic idyll and a clear-eyed meditation on love, L’ATALANTE, Vigo’s only feature-length work, is a film like no other."

Hewing faithfully to Brecht&#39;s text, Schlöndorff juxtaposes the theatricality of the prose with bare-bones, handheld 16 mm camera work, which gives immediacy to this savage story of rebellion.

Writer-director Woody Allen’s supremely silly third feature channels the absurdity of the Marx brothers for a side-splitting satire of Cold War politics and American imperialism. He stars as bumbling New York City product tester Fielding Mellish, who, after he’s jilted by his activist girlfriend (Louise Lasser), heads to the tiny Latin American republic of San Marcos for vacation—only to wind up becoming the unwitting leader of a political revolution. Among the highlights: legendary sports announcer Howard Cosell delivering a honeymoon-night bedroom “play-by-play” and an uncredited appearance from a pre-stardom Sylvester Stallone as a subway thug."

This outrageous blend of science fiction, high camp, and erotic fantasia made Jane Fonda a permanent cult icon. She is sensational as a wide-eyed space adventurer whose quest to track down a famed scientist takes her to the Tau Ceti galaxy, where she encounters an array of perilously kinky pleasures. Described by director Roger Vadim as “a kind of sexual ‘Alice in Wonderland’ of the future,” BARBARELLA has taken its place as a midnight-movie classic thanks to its trippy art direction and sense of kitschy comic-book fun."

Julian Schnabel’s tribute to his friend and fellow painter Jean-Michel Basquiat is less a conventional biopic than an impressionistic, sensory immersion into the much-mythologized downtown-Manhattan art world of the 1980s. Jeffrey Wright, in his first lead film role, stars as the visionary artist whose rise from graffiti tagger to art star forces him to confront the glare of sudden fame, along with racism, his own struggles with addiction, and the difficulties of being self-determining and free in America. Bolstered by an ensemble cast that includes a sublime performance by David Bowie channeling Andy Warhol, Schnabel’s directorial debut is a profoundly expressive elegy for a radiant life cut short."

One of the most influential political films in history, THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, by Gillo Pontecorvo, vividly re-creates a key year in the tumultuous Algerian struggle for independence from the occupying French in the 1950s. As violence escalates on both sides, children shoot soldiers at point-blank range, women plant bombs in cafés, and French soldiers resort to torture to break the will of the insurgents. Shot on the streets of Algiers in documentary style, the film is a case study in modern warfare, with its terrorist attacks and the brutal techniques used to combat them.

“If we opened people up, we’d find landscapes. If we opened me up, we’d find beaches.” Originally intended to be Agnès Varda’s farewell to filmmaking, this enchanting auto-portrait, made in her eightieth year, is a freewheeling journey through her life, career, and artistic philosophy. Revisiting the places that shaped her—from the North Sea beaches of Belgium where she spent her childhood to the Mediterranean village where she shot her first film to the boardwalks of Los Angeles where she lived with her husband, Jacques Demy—Varda reflects on a lifetime of creation and inspiration, successes and setbacks, heartbreak and joy. Replete with images of wonder and whimsy—the ocean reflected in a kaleidoscope of mirrors, the streets of Paris transformed into a sandy beach, the filmmaker herself ensconced in the belly of a whale—The Beaches of Agnès is a playful and poignant record of a life lived fully and passionately in the name of cinema."

Amid the azure waters and sunbaked desert landscapes of Djibouti, a French Foreign Legion sergeant (Denis Lavant) sows the seeds of his own ruin as his obsession with a striking young recruit (Grégoire Colin) plays out to the thunderous, operatic strains of Benjamin Britten. Denis and cinematographer Agnès Godard fold military and masculine codes of honor, colonialism’s legacy, destructive jealousy, and repressed desire into shimmering, hypnotic images that ultimately explode in one of the most startling and unforgettable endings in all of modern cinema."

When it is revealed that he is actually impotent and that his marriage to his beautiful wife (Claudia Cardinale) is still unconsummated after a year, he finds himself at the center of a town scandal."

Directed by Luis Buñuel • 1967 • France
Starring Catherine Deneuve, Jean Sorel, Michel Piccoli

Catherine Deneuve’s porcelain perfection hides a cracked interior in one of the actress’s most iconic roles: Séverine, a Paris housewife who begins secretly spending her after­noon hours working in a bordello. This surreal and erotic late-sixties daydream from provocateur for the ages Luis Buñuel is an examination of desire and fetishistic pleasure (its characters’ and its viewers’), as well as a gently absurdist take on contemporary social mores and class divisions. Fantasy and reality commingle in this burst of cinematic transgression, which was one of Buñuel’s biggest hits."

Starring Jorge Sanz, Penélope Cruz, Maribel Verdú

Winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, this rollicking, sensual romp unfolds in early-1930s Spain, where Fernando (Jorge Sanz), a handsome young Civil War deserter, goes AWOL and seeks refuge in the sprawling country home of a free-thinking artist (Fernando Fernán Gómez). There, he finds himself in a romantic dilemma when the artist’s four beautiful daughters (among them Penélope Cruz in one of her first film roles) returns home—which woman should he romance? The answer proves hilariously simple, as Fernando is seduced instead by each of the high-spirited, sexually liberated sisters."

Starring Michel Piccoli, Jane Birkin, Emmanuelle Béart

Jacques Rivette’s abiding fascination with the interplay between life and art receives one of its most spellbinding treatments in this sensuous, hypnotic exploration of the creative process. Taking its inspiration from a Balzac story, LA BELLE NOISEUSE centers on the tension that arises between an aging painter (Michel Piccoli) and his young model (Emmanuelle Béart) as he obsessively attempts to capture a truth beyond physical reality. Winner of the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, this slow-burn epic is a mesmerizing exploration of the very limits of artistic creation."

Starring Virginie Efira, Charlotte Rampling, Daphné Patakia

The ever-provocative Paul Verhoeven brings his subversive vision to a seventeenth-century convent for this ecstatically blasphemous tale of religion, sex, scandal, and plague inspired by the true story of Benedetta Carlini (played by Virginie Efira), an Italian nun who becomes entangled in a forbidden lesbian affair with a novice. But it is Benedetta’s shocking religious visions that threaten to shake the Church to its core. Far from a standard biopic, Verhoeven’s take on the story transforms Benedetta’s life into a delirious, salaciously satirical melodrama roiling with eros and violence."

Far from a standard music documentary, Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen’s loving portrait of underground musician Benjamin Smoke—speed freak, drag queen, and a true outsider artist in every sense of the word—captures his singular personality (described by Cohen as a kind of “Deep South, dirt-poor Oscar Wilde”), mesmerizing performances, and the unique world of his Cabbagetown neighborhood in Atlanta.

Michael Haneke turns the unflinching gaze of the camera back on itself in this provocative, profoundly disturbing study of emotional disconnection in the age of mass-media saturation. Benny (a frighteningly affectless Arno Frisch), the teenage son of wealthy, disengaged parents, finds release in the world of violent videos—an obsession that leads him to create his own monstrous work of real-life horror. Layering screens within screens and frames within the filmic frame, BENNY’S VIDEO is a coolly postmodern, metacinematic labyrinth in which the boundaries between actual and mediated violence become terrifyingly indistinguishable."

Just four years before his death, legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman sat down with Swedish documentarian Marie Nyreröd at his home on Fårö Island to discuss his work, his fears, his regrets, and his ongoing artistic passion. This resulted in the most breathtakingly candid series of interviews that the famously reclusive director ever took part in, later edited into the feature-length film BERGMAN ISLAND. In-depth, revealing, and packed with choice anecdotes about Bergman’s oeuvre, as well as his personal life, Nyreröd’s film is an unforgettable final glimpse of a man who transformed cinema."

In search of inspiration for their current filmmaking projects, Chris (Vicky Krieps) and her partner (Tim Roth) travel to the remote island of Fårö, Sweden, where Bergman lived and worked for decades. There, the spirit of the cinema master looms as Chris confronts her complicated relationships to work, men, motherhood, and her artistic influences. Also featuring radiant performances from Mia Wasikowska and Anders Danielsen Lie, BERGMAN ISLAND is a rich deconstruction of the mysteries of the creative process and the journey that every film takes from thought to page to screen."

When the easygoing would-be novelist Zorg (Jean-Hugues Anglade) meets the tempestuous Betty (Béatrice Dalle, in a magnetic breakout performance) in a sunbaked French beach town, it’s the beginning of a whirlwind love affair that sees the pair turn their backs on conventional society in favor of the hedonistic pursuit of freedom, adventure, and carnal pleasure. But as the increasingly erratic Betty’s grip on reality begins to falter, Zorg finds himself willing to do things he never expected to protect both her fragile sanity and their tenuous existence together.

In this unconventional documentary, Betty tells her story of the search for the “perfect dress” twice—first as a humorous anecdote and again as her underlying feelings emerge. The contrast between the two stories is haunting."

Inspired by director Joan Micklin Silver’s time working at New York’s storied alt weekly the “Village Voice,” this unsung gem of 1970s slice-of-life seriocomedy offers an incisive, bittersweet look at a shifting media landscape that feels as fresh and relevant as ever. At the offices of a Boston independent newspaper, the staff members—including music critic Max (Jeff Goldblum, in one of his first leading roles), news reporter Harry (John Heard) and photographer Abbie (Lindsay Crouse)—enjoy a positive and open-minded work environment. However, it seems as though their relatively carefree days are numbered when the owner of a major publishing company buys the paper, leading to more money, but big changes."

With this arresting drama based on notorious real-life events, Cristian Mungiu mounts a complex inquiry into faith, fanaticism, and indifference. At a desolate Romanian monastery, a young novice nun, Voichita (Cosmina Stratan), reunites with her former companion Alina (Cristina Flutur), who plans to take her to Germany. But Voichita proves unwilling to abandon her calling, and Alina becomes increasingly desperate to reclaim her devotion, putting the outsider at odds with the monastery&#39;s ascetic priest, and precipitating a painfully misguided, brutal attempt to save her soul. A naturalistic tragedy with the dark force of a folktale, anchored by the fraught dynamic between cinema newcomers Flutur and Stratan (who shared the best actress prize at Cannes), BEYOND THE HILLS bears powerful witness to individuals at cross-purposes and institutions ill-equipped to help those most in need."

Ousmane Sembène was one of the greatest and most groundbreaking filmmakers who ever lived, as well as the most renowned African director of the twentieth century—and yet his name still deserves to be better known in the rest of the world. He made his feature debut in 1966 with the brilliant and stirring BLACK GIRL. Sembène, who was also an acclaimed novelist in his native Senegal, transforms a deceptively simple plot—about a young Senegalese woman who moves to France to work for a wealthy white family and finds that life in their small apartment becomes a prison, both figuratively and literally—into a complexly layered critique of the lingering colonialist mind-set of a supposedly postcolonial world. Featuring a moving central performance by M’Bissine Thérèse Diop, BLACK GIRL is a harrowing human drama as well as a radical political statement—and one of the essential films of the 1960s.

The extraordinary cast—including Reverend Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick, attorney and feminist activist Florynce “Flo” Kennedy, musicians Jim Collier, Wende Smith, Larry Johnson, and Reverend Gary Davis—tell stories of heartbreak and despair while their songs blow the roof off the rafters.

Uncomfortable silences, botched flirtations, and fleeting hints of warmth and humor punctuate Sylvia’s aching descent into solitude, compassionately portrayed by Leigh as symptomatic of humanity’s struggle to communicate and connect."

BLESS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS distills the social concerns and neorealist aesthetics of the movement into a sensitive exploration of the inner workings of community and family that pays homage to the power of the blues. Searching for steady work, Charlie Banks (Nate Hardman) views his chronic unemployment as a kind of spiritual trial. But day work and selling a few catfish can’t sustain a family of five. While his wife Andais (a remarkable Kaycee Moore) works to support them with dignity, Charlie finds comfort for his wounded sense of manhood in an affair that threatens his marriage and family."

This unforgettable film follows Witek (the magnetic Bogusław Linda), a medical student with an uncertain future in Communist Poland; Kieślowski dramatizes Witek’s journey as a series of different possibilities, suggesting that chance rules our lives as much as choice does.

Things go decidedly not as planned when she summons the spirit of his dead first wife (Kay Hammond), a severe inconvenience for his current one (Constance Cummings). Employing Oscar-winning special effects to spruce up Coward’s theatrical farce, BLITHE SPIRIT is a sprightly supernatural comedy with winning performances."

Strong performances and ingenious special effects help THE BLOB transcend the schlock sci-fi and youth delinquency genres from which it originates.

Joel and Ethan Coen’s career-long darkly comic road trip through misfit America began with this razor-sharp, hard-boiled neonoir set somewhere in Texas, where a sleazy bar owner releases a torrent of violence with one murderous thought. Actor M. Emmet Walsh looms over the proceedings as a slippery private eye with a yellow suit, a cowboy hat, and no moral compass, and Frances McDormand’s cunning debut performance set her on the road to stardom. The tight scripting and inventive style that have marked the Coens’ work for decades are all here in their first film, in which cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld abandons black-and-white chiaroscuro for neon signs and jukebox colors that combine with Carter Burwell’s haunting score to lurid and thrilling effect. Blending elements from pulp fiction and low-budget horror flicks, BLOOD SIMPLE reinvented the film noir for a new generation, marking the arrival of a filmmaking ensemble that would transform the American independent cinema scene."

Before carving out a niche as one of the most distinct voices in nineties American cinema, Allison Anders made her debut, alongside codirectors and fellow UCLA film school students Kurt Voss and Dean Lent, with 1987’s BORDER RADIO. A low-key, semi-improvised postpunk diary that took four years to complete, BORDER RADIO features legendary rocker Chris D., of the Flesh Eaters, as a singer/songwriter who has stolen loot from a club and gone missing, leaving his wife (Luanna Anders), a no-nonsense rock journalist, to track him down with the help of his friends (John Doe of the band X; Chris Shearer). With its sprawling Southern Californian and Mexican landscapes, captured in evocative 16mm black and white, BORDER RADIO is a singular, DIY memento of the indie film explosion in America."

The film that rocked the foundations of the 1980s underground, this postpunk provocation is a DIY fantasia of female rebellion set in America ten years after a social-democratic cultural revolution. When Adelaide Norris (Jean Satterfield), the black revolutionary founder of the Woman’s Army, is mysteriously killed, a diverse coalition of women—across all lines of race, class, and sexual orientation—emerges to blow the system apart. Filmed guerrilla style on the streets of pre-gentrification New York, BORN IN FLAMES is a Molotov cocktail of feminist futurism that’s both an essential document of its time and radically ahead of it.

Shot on location in and around a pregentrification Times Square, this first American film from Czech transplant Ivan Passer (CUTTER’S WAY) blends offbeat comedy with grimy realism to portray the hard-knock hustle of life on the streets.

Firebrand auteur Nagisa Oshima offers a devastating vision of moral rot within postwar Japanese society in the form of a hauntingly sad family tragedy. Inspired by a scandalous true story, BOY follows ten-year-old Toshio (Tetsuo Abe, an orphan whose real life mirrored the tumultuous upbringing of his character) whose grifter parents use him as a pawn in a scheme to stage car accidents and then extort money from the drivers. As the family crisscrosses Japan in an increasingly desperate attempt to elude the law, Toshio escapes into an imaginary world of science-fiction fantasy and space aliens that he dreams will deliver him from his harrowing existence. Applying the blistering stylistic experimentation of his earlier Japanese New Wave touchstones with newfound restraint, Oshima adopts a relatively sober docudrama approach that proves no less shocking and subversive in its emotionally annihilating portrait of a stolen childhood."

Starring Oliver Reed, Samantha Eggar, Art Hindle

A disturbed woman is receiving a radical form of psychotherapy at a remote, mysterious institute. Meanwhile, her five-year-old daughter, under the care of her estranged husband, is being terrorized by a group of demonic beings. How these two story lines connect is the shocking and grotesque secret of this bloody tale of monstrous parenthood from David Cronenberg, starring Oliver Reed and Samantha Eggar. With its combination of psychological and body horror, THE BROOD laid the groundwork for many of the director’s films to come, but it stands on its own as a personal, singularly scary vision."

Following a three-year break from filmmaking while he completed military service, Yasujiro Ozu returned to directing with this pointed family drama which in many ways anticipates the themes he would explore again in TOKYO STORY. His distinctive, contemplative rhythms are on beautiful display in the story of a widow (Ayako Katsuragi) who discovers that her recently deceased husband has left her with nothing but debt and married children who are unwilling to support her—until her most forceful son (Shin Saburi) returns from China and shakes things up."

Redgrave portrays Andrew Crocker-Harris, an embittered, middle-aged schoolmaster who begins to feel that his life has been a failure. Diminished by poor health, a crumbling marriage, and the derision of his pupils, the once brilliant scholar is compelled to reexamine his life when a young student offers an unexpected gesture of kindness. A heartbreaking story of remorse and atonement, THE BROWNING VERSION is a classic of British realism and the winner of best actor and best screenplay honors at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival."

As hard-hitting as its title, BRUTE FORCE was the first of Jules Dassin’s forays into the crime genre, a prison melodrama that takes a critical look at American society as well. Burt Lancaster is the timeworn Joe Collins, who, along with his fellow inmates, lives under the heavy thumb of the sadistic, power-tripping guard Captain Munsey (a riveting Hume Cronyn). Only Collins’s dreams of escape keep him going, but how can he possibly bust out of Munsey’s chains? Matter-of-fact and ferocious, BRUTE FORCE builds to an explosive climax that shows the lengths men will go to when fighting for their freedom."

Traveling from the streets of Havana to the stage of Carnegie Hall, this revelatory documentary captures a forgotten generation of Cuba’s brightest musical talents as they enjoy an unexpected encounter with world fame. The veteran vocalists and instru­mentalists collaborated with American guitarist and roots-music champion Ry Cooder to form the Buena Vista Social Club, playing a jazz-inflected mix of cha-cha, mambo, bolero, and other traditional Latin American styles, and recording an album that won a Grammy and made them an international phenomenon. In the wake of this success, director Wim Wenders filmed the ensemble’s members—including golden-voiced Ibrahim Ferrer and piano virtuoso Rubén González—in a series of illuminating interviews and live performances. The result is one of the most beloved documentaries of the 1990s, and an infectious ode to a neglected corner of Cuba’s prerevolutionary heritage."

Death haunts a close-knit Mexican community in this evocatively spare, slow-burn documentary spellbinder. With a remarkably unobtrusive camera, director Juan Pablo González chronicles the everyday rituals and rhythms of life in a small, struggling rural town in the state of Jalisco where daily conversation seemingly turns again and again to one topic: the recent suicide of a young caballerango (horse wrangler) whose death, we soon learn, is only the latest in a rash of suicides that have plagued the village. Finding stirring poignancy in seemingly quotidian moments, CABALLERANGO is a transcendentally sad and beautiful reflection on vanishing traditions and disappearing lives."

Youssef Chahine established his international reputation with this masterpiece, which, though initially a commercial flop at home, would become one of the most influential and celebrated works in all of Arab cinema. The director himself stars as Kenawi, a simpleton newspaper hawker whose obsession with a sultry drink seller (Hind Rostom, the so-dubbed “Marilyn Monroe of Arabia”) leads to tragedy of operatic proportions on the streets of Cairo. Blending elements of neorealism (naturalistic dialogue, location shooting, and a vivid evocation of labor struggle in the postwar epoch) with provocative noir-melodrama (lust, jealousy, madness, and murder), CAIRO STATION is a work of raw populist poetry that explores the individual’s search for a place in Egypt’s new political order."

Through a series of episodic juxtapositions, Johnson explores the relationships between image makers and their subjects, the tension between the objectivity and intervention of the camera, and the complex interaction of unfiltered reality with crafted narrative. A work that combines documentary, autobiography, and ethical inquiry, CAMERAPERSON is a moving glimpse into one filmmaker’s personal journey and a thoughtful examination of what it means to train a camera on the world."

Mark Lewis takes the nature documentary into new realms of the humorous, surreal, and downright bizarre with this stranger-than-fiction tale of the ultimate environmental self-own. The cane toad—Bufo marinus, a species native to Central America—was imported by the sack-load to Australia in 1935 in an attempt to rid the country of the greyback beetle, which was rapidly destroying the sugarcane crop. The toads adapted beautifully to their new surroundings. Problem was, the beetle could fly and they couldn’t. What the cane toad is unusually proficient at, however, is making more cane toads—thousands upon thousands more. CANE TOADS: AN UNNATURAL HISTORY tells the wild story of this amphibious assault—warts and all."

Director Felipe Cazals adopts a gritty documentary style to narrate the events in CANOA while referencing the climate of political repression that would lead to the massacre of student protesters in Mexico City shortly thereafter. The resulting film is a daring commentary on ideological manipulation, religious fanaticism, and mass violence, as well as a visceral expression of horror."

Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s beloved classic A CANTERBURY TALE is a profoundly personal journey to Powell’s bucolic birthplace of Kent, England. Set amid the tumult of the Second World War, yet with a rhythm as delicate as a lullaby, the film follows three modern-day incarnations of Chaucer’s pilgrims—a melancholy “landgirl,” a plainspoken American GI, and a resourceful British sergeant—who are waylaid in the English countryside en route to the mythical town and forced to solve a bizarre village crime. Building to a majestic climax that ranks as one of the filmmaking duo’s finest achievements, the dazzling A CANTERBURY TALE has acquired a following of devotees passionate enough to qualify as pilgrims themselves."

Woe be to any outsider who inadvertently stumbles upon the insular outback town of Paris, where the strange citizens subsist through a most unusual economy: deliberately causing car accidents and then salvaging the wreckage for profit. Survivors, if there are any, are similarly harvested for medical experiments. But not all is well in Paris. One unwilling resident (Terry Camilleri) senses something amiss, while the town’s teenage youths have begun a disturbing revolt of their own."

Shuttling its hapless protagonist through a series of increasingly outlandish, tragicomic set pieces, the second of only two features made by Pavel Juráček—a renegade whose career was effectively squashed by state censors—is among the Czechoslovak New Wave’s most daring commentaries on life under totalitarianism."

Starring Simone Signoret, Serge Reggiani, Claude Dauphin

Jacques Becker lovingly evokes the belle epoque Parisian demimonde in this classic tale of doomed romance. When gangster’s moll Marie (Simone Signoret) falls for reformed criminal Manda (Serge Reggiani), their passion incites an underworld rivalry that leads inexorably to treachery and tragedy. With poignant, nuanced performances and sensuous black-and-white photography, CASQUE D&#39;OR (GOLDEN MARIE) is Becker at the height of his cinematic powers, a romantic masterpiece."

Starring Jan Werich, Emília Vášáryová, Vlastimil Brodský

In this modern-day fairy tale and rediscovered Czech New Wave cult classic, an ordinary Bohemian village is visited by a magician (Jan Werich), his beautiful assistant (Emília Vásáryová), and a magic cat with the power to reveal people in colors that indicate their true natures: yellow for the unfaithful, purple for liars, red for lovers like Robert (Vlastimil Brodský), a bighearted schoolteacher whose independence of thought places him at odds with the town’s conservative authorities. When the cat reveals the villagers as they really are and the town descends into whimsical chaos, humorless school principal Karel (Jiří Sovák) vows to hunt down the feline and put an end to its anarchic reign. Ahead of its time in experimenting with stylized color and extended political metaphor, THE CASSANDRA CAT is director Vojtěch Jasný’s triumphant excursion into fantasy as a mirror of real-life social divisions and hypocrisies."

One of the most harrowing Hollywood films to confront the legacy of the Vietnam War, CASUALTIES OF WAR is based on the true story of a squad of soldiers caught in a moral quagmire. Witness to a vile crime, Private Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) is forced to stand alone against his fellow soldiers and commanding officer Sergeant Meserve (Sean Penn), a powerful and charismatic man pushed over the edge of barbarism by the terror and brutality of combat. With sweeping scope, intense action, and raw power, Brian De Palma creates a devastating and unforgettable tale of one man’s quest for sanity and justice amid the chaos of war."

Attempts to recapture her fail, provoking further division and eventual war between the animistic Ceddo and the fundamentalist Muslims, with Christian missionaries and slave traders from Europe also playing a role in the conflict.

The Danish Dogme 95 movement that struck world cinema like a thunderbolt began with THE CELEBRATION, Thomas Vinterberg’s international breakthrough, a lacerating chamber drama that uses the economic and aesthetic freedoms of digital video to achieve annihilating emotional intensity. On a wealthy man’s sixtieth birthday, a sprawling group of family and friends convenes at his country estate for a celebration that soon spirals into bedlam, as bombshell revelations threaten to tear away the veneer of bourgeois respectability and expose the traumas roiling beneath. The dynamic handheld camera work, grainy natural lighting, cacophonous diegetic sound, and raw performance style that would become Dogme hallmarks enhance the shattering visceral impact of this caustic indictment of patriarchal failings, which swings between blackest comedy and bleakest tragedy as it turns the sick soul of a family inside out."

Whiling away a summer in Paris, director Jacques Rivette, working in close collaboration with his stars and coconspirators Juliet Berto and Dominique Labourier, set out to rewrite the rules of cinema in the spirit of pure play—moviemaking as an anything-goes romp through the labyrinths of imagination. The result is one of the most exuberantly inventive and utterly enchanting films of the French New Wave, in which Julie (Labourier), a daydreaming librarian, meets Céline (Berto), an enigmatic magician, and together they become the heroines of a time-warping adventure involving a haunted house, psychotropic candy, and a murder-mystery melodrama. Incorporating allusions to everything from Lewis Carroll to Louis Feuillade, CÉLINE AND JULIE GO BOATING is both one of the all-time-great hangout comedies and a totally unique, enveloping cinematic dream space that delights in the endless pleasures and possibilities of stories."

A fascinatingly enigmatic, César Award–winning Isabelle Huppert is the chaotic yin to Sandrine Bonnaire’s tightly coiled yang. They are, respectively, a small-town postal worker and a maid to a wealthy family, a pair of outsiders who form a mysterious alliance that gradually, almost imperceptibly, goes haywire.

Starring Michel Simon, Janie Marèse, Georges Flamant

Jean Renoir&#39;s ruthless love triangle tale, his second sound film, is a true precursor to his brilliantly bitter THE RULES OF THE GAME, displaying all of the filmmaker&#39;s visual genius and fully imbued with his profound humanity. Michel Simon cuts a tragic figure as an unhappily married cashier and amateur painter who becomes so smitten with a prostitute that he refuses to see the obvious: that she and her pimp boyfriend are taking advantage of him. Renoir&#39;s elegant compositions and camera movements carry this twisting narrative, a stinging commentary on class and sexual divisions, to an unforgettably ironic conclusion."

A child’s angelic face conceals a budding sociopath in the audacious, senses- shattering feature debut from actor-turned-filmmaker Brady Corbet (THE BRUTALIST). A powerhouse international cast led by Robert Pattinson and Bérénice Bejo headlines this dark domestic nightmare, set amid the turmoil of World War I and its aftermath, in which the young son of an American diplomat living in France gradually learns to manipulate the adults around him—a monstrous coming of age that ominously parallels the rising tide of fascism in Europe. This stylistically fearless tour de force reaches fever-pitch delirium through ravishing cinematography and a thunderous score by Scott Walker."

Poetic realism reached sublime heights with CHILDREN OF PARADISE, widely considered one of the greatest French films of all time. This nimble depiction of nineteenth-century Paris’s theatrical demimonde, filmed during World War II, follows a mysterious woman (Arletty) loved by four different men (all based on historical figures): an actor, a criminal, a count, and, most poignantly, a mime (Jean-Louis Barrault, in a longing-suffused performance for the ages). With sensitivity and dramatic élan, director Marcel Carné and screenwriter Jacques Prévert resurrect a world teeming with hucksters and aristocrats, thieves and courtesans, pimps and seers."

Starring Orson Welles, Keith Baxter, Jeanne Moreau

The crowning achievement of Orson Welles’s extraordinary cinematic career, CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT was the culmination of the filmmaker’s lifelong obsession with Shakespeare’s ultimate rapscallion, Sir John Falstaff. Usually a comic supporting figure, Falstaff—the loyal, often soused friend of King Henry IV’s wayward son Prince Hal—here becomes the focus: a robustly funny and ultimately tragic screen antihero played by Welles with looming, lumbering grace. Integrating elements from both “Henry IV” plays as well as “Richard II,” “Henry V,” and “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” Welles created a gritty and unorthodox Shakespeare film as a lament, he said, “for the death of Merrie England.” Poetic, philosophical, and visceral—with a kinetic centerpiece battle sequence that rivals anything in the director’s body of work—CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT is as monumental as the figure at its heart."

It’s within this precarious ecosystem that twelve-year-old Ale (Alejandro Polanco) must grow up fast, hustling in the neighborhood chop shops to build a more stable life for himself and his sister (Isamar Gonzales), even as their tenuous circumstances force each to compete with other struggling people and make desperate decisions. A deeply human story of a fierce but fragile sibling bond being tested by hardscrabble reality, CHOP SHOP tempers its sobering authenticity with flights of lyricism and hope."

Few films can claim as much influence on the course of cinema history as CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER. The fascinating result of a collaboration between filmmaker-anthropologist Jean Rouch and sociologist Edgar Morin, this vanguard work of what Morin termed cinéma- vérité is a brilliantly conceived and realized sociopolitical diagnosis of the early sixties in France. Simply by interviewing a group of Paris residents in the summer of 1960—beginning with the provocative and eternal question “Are you happy?” and expanding to political issues, including the ongoing Algerian War—Rouch and Morin reveal the hopes and dreams of a wide array of people, from artists to factory workers, from an Italian émigré to an African student. CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER’s penetrative approach gives us a document of a time and place with extraordinary emotional depth."

Directed by Lucrecia Martel • 2001 • Argentina
Starring Martín Adjemián, Diego Baenas, Leonora Balcarce

The release of Lucrecia Martel’s LA CIÉNAGA heralded the arrival of an astonishingly vital and original voice in Argentine cinema. With a radical and disturbing take on narrative, beautiful cinematography, and a highly sophisticated use of on- and offscreen sound, Martel turns her tale of a dissolute bourgeois extended family, whiling away the hours of one sweaty, sticky summer, into a cinematic marvel. This visceral take on class, nature, sexuality, and the ways that political turmoil and social stagnation can manifest in human relationships is a drama of extraordinary tactility, and one of the great contemporary film debuts."

In the last film he made during the silent era, Charlie Chaplin revels in the art of the circus, paying tribute to the acrobats and pantomimists who inspired his virtuoso pratfalls. After being mistaken for a pickpocket, Chaplin’s Tramp flees into the ring of a traveling circus and soon becomes the star of the show, falling for the troupe’s bareback rider along the way. Despite its famously troubled production, this gag-packed comedy ranks among Chaplin’s finest, thanks to some of the most audacious set pieces of the director-performer’s career, including a close brush with a lion and a climactic tightrope walk with a barrelful of monkeys. THE CIRCUS, which was rereleased in 1969 with a new score by Chaplin, is an uproarious high-wire act that showcases silent cinema’s most popular entertainer at the peak of his comic powers."

CITY LIGHTS, the most cherished film by Charlie Chaplin, is also his ultimate Little Tramp chronicle. The writer-director-star achieved new levels of grace, in both physical comedy and dramatic poignancy, with this silent tale of a lovable vagrant falling for a young blind woman who sells flowers on the street (a magical Virginia Cherrill) and mistakes him for a millionaire. Though this Depression-era smash was made after the advent of sound, Chaplin remained steadfast in his love for the expressive beauty of the pre-talkie form. The result was the epitome of his art and the crowning achievement of silent comedy."

He spends his July at a lakeside boardinghouse, nursing crushes on the sixteen-year-old Laura and, more tantalizingly, her long-legged, blonde, older half sister, Claire. Baring her knee on a ladder under a blooming cherry tree, Claire unwittingly incites a moral crisis for Jerôme while creating an image that is both the iconic emblem of Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales and one of French cinema’s most enduring moments."

Set during the turbulent late-1960s period leading up to Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan, this lyrical drama tells the story of a family torn apart by religion and war. Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu), a shy young boy from rural East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), is sent away by his father, an orthodox Muslim, to a madrassa, or Islamic school. Far from his family and the warmth of his region’s Hindu festivities, Anu struggles to adapt to the school’s harsh monastic life. As the political divisions in the country intensify, a widening split develops between the moderate and extremist forces within the madrasah and within Anu’s own family. Touching upon themes of religious tolerance, cultural diversity, and the complexity of Islam, THE CLAY BIRD has universal relevance in a crisis-ridden world."

She watches helplessly as her own hopes and desires are pushed aside time and again by those of her siblings and parents, until all her chances for happiness evaporate, leaving her crushed and ailing. Experimenting with off-balance compositions, discontinuous editing, and a densely layered soundtrack, Ghatak devised an intellectually ambitious and emotionally devastating new shape for the melodrama, lamenting the tragedies of Indian history and the inequities of traditional gender roles while blazing a formal trail for the generations of Indian filmmakers who have followed him."

The always extraordinary Juliette Binoche is stirring as Maria, a stage and screen icon who is being courted to star in a new production of the play that made her famous—only this time she must assume the role of the older woman. Kristen Stewart matches her punch for punch as her beleaguered assistant, called upon to provide support both professional and emotional for her mercurial boss. And Chloë Grace Moretz is Maria’s callow new castmate, a starlet waiting in the wings.

Composed almost entirely of brilliantly shot, single-take vignettes focusing on characters connected to one seemingly minor incident on a Paris street, Haneke’s film—with an outstanding international cast headlined by Juliette Binoche—is a revelatory examination of racial inequality and the failure of communication in an increasingly diverse modern landscape."

An acclaimed early work by Olivier Assayas, the long-unavailable, deeply felt coming-of-age drama COLD WATER can at last be seen in the United States. Drawing from his own youthful experiences, Assayas revisits the outskirts of Paris in the early 1970s, telling the story of teenage lovers Gilles (Cyprien Fouquet) and Christine (Virginie Ledoyen), whose rebellions against family and society threaten to tear them apart. The visceral realism of the movie’s narrative and the near experimentalism of its camera work come together effortlessly thanks in part to a rock soundtrack that vividly evokes the period. COLD WATER, whose centerpiece is one of the most memorable party sequences ever committed to film, is a heartbreaking immersion in the emotional tumult of being young."

In a series of tableaux that blend the tactile with the abstract, THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES revives the splendors of Armenian culture through the story of the eighteenth-century troubadour Sayat-Nova, charting his intellectual, artistic, and spiritual growth through iconographic compositions rather than traditional narrative. The film’s tapestry of folklore and metaphor departed from the realism that dominated the Soviet cinema of its era, leading authorities to block its distribution, with rare underground screenings presenting it in a restructured form.

Rather than the adventure and glory he envisioned, what he finds is a waking nightmare of unimaginable carnage and cruelty—rendered with a feverish, otherworldly intensity by Klimov’s subjective camera work and expressionistic sound design.

As in his previous docufiction landmark ON THE BOWERY, Rogosin immersed himself in the world of his subjects, in this case in the Black cultural hub of Sophiatown, a vibrant center of music, art, literature, and politics that was soon to be razed by the government to make way for a whites-only suburb. Largely improvised by a nonprofessional cast that includes legendary singer and activist Miriam Makeba, Come Back, Africa reveals both the cruelty of apartheid and the vitality of a community struggling for equality."

A mysterious writer of poison-pen letters, known only as Le Corbeau (the Raven), plagues a French provincial town, unwittingly exposing the collective suspicion and rancor seething beneath the community’s calm surface. Made during the Nazi Occupation of France, Henri-Georges Clouzot’s LE CORBEAU was attacked by the right-wing Vichy regime, the left-wing Resistance press, and the Catholic Church, and it was banned after the Liberation. But some—including Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre—recognized the powerful subtext to Clouzot’s anti-informant, anti-Gestapo fable, and worked to rehabilitate Clouzot’s directorial reputation after the war. LE CORBEAU brilliantly captures a spirit of paranoid pettiness and self-loathing turning an occupied French town into a twentieth-century Salem."

Carlos Saura’s exquisite CRÍA CUERVOS . . . heralded a turning point in Spain: shot while General Franco was on his deathbed, the film melds the personal and the political in a portrait of the legacy of fascism and its effects on a middle-class family (the title derives from the Spanish proverb: “Raise ravens and they&#39;ll peck out your eyes” Ana Torrent (the dark-eyed beauty from THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE) portrays the disturbed eight-year-old Ana, living in Madrid with her two sisters and mourning the death of her mother, whom she conjures as a ghost (an ethereal Geraldine Chaplin). Seamlessly shifting between fantasy and reality, the film subtly evokes both the complex feelings of childhood and the struggles of a nation emerging from the shadows."

Starring Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin

This existential wail of a drama concerns two sisters, Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann), keeping vigil for a third, Agnes (Harriet Andersson), who is dying of cancer and can find solace only in the arms of a beatific servant (Kari Sylwan). An intensely felt film that is one of Bergman’s most striking formal experiments, CRIES AND WHISPERS (which won an Oscar for the extraordinary color photography by Sven Nykvist) is a powerful depiction of human behavior in the face of death, positioned on the borders between reality and nightmare, tranquility and terror."

An oft-overlooked jewel from Jean Renoir, this exuberant ode to working-class solidarity is both one of the director’s most thoroughly charming works as well as one of his most sly political statements. Channeling the collectivist, utopian spirit of the Popular Front movement, THE CRIME OF MONSIEUR LANGE combines comedy with thriller elements to tell the story of a publishing house where the exploited employees form a collective following the sudden death of their tyrannical boss. When the supposedly dead man unexpectedly returns, a mild-mannered writer of Western serials (René Lefèvre) takes matters into his own hands."

Starring Inga Landgré, Marianne Löfgren

 With his very first film as a director, made under the mentorship of the silent-film maestro Victor Sjöström, Ingmar Bergman began exploring a couple of the essential themes of his early period: youth pitted against crass society and the tensions between men and women. The eighteen-year-old Nelly (Inga Landgré), who lives with her foster mother in a quiet provincial town, is shaken by the sudden arrival of her birth mother (Marianne Löfgren), who eventually takes her to Stockholm—where Nelly receives a crash course in corruption and wrenching heartbreak. CRISIS proved that Bergman had an incipient gift for developing characters and evoking atmosphere on-screen."

Guillermo del Toro made an auspicious and audacious feature debut with CRONOS, a highly unorthodox tale about the seductiveness of the idea of immortality. Kindly antiques dealer Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi) happens upon an ancient golden device in the shape of a scarab, and soon finds himself the possessor and victim of its sinister, addictive powers, as well as the target of a mysterious American named Angel (a delightfully crude and deranged Ron Perlman).

But what happens when the fun is over? Matching her anarchic message with an equally radical aesthetic, director Věra Chytilová, with the close collaboration of cinematographer Jaroslav Kučera, unleashes an optical storm of fluctuating film stocks, kaleidoscopic montages, cartoonish stop-motion cutouts, and surreal costumes designed by Ester Krumbachová, who also cowrote the script.

Gérard Depardieu and Wojciech Pszoniak star in Andrzej Wajda&#39;s powerful, intimate depiction of the ideological clash between the earthy, man-of-the-people Georges Danton and icy Jacobin extremist Maximilien Robespierre, both key figures of the French Revolution. By drawing parallels to Polish &quot;solidarity,&quot; a movement that was being quashed by the government as the film went into production, Wajda drags history into the present.

Based on a short story by RING author Koji Suzuki, DARK WATER follows Yoshimi (Hitomi Kuroki), a single mother struggling to win sole custody of her daughter. When they move into a new home in a dilapidated apartment complex, Yoshimi begins to experience startling visions and unexplainable sounds, calling her mental well-being into question and endangering not only her custody case but perhaps her and her child’s lives as well.

A hard-hitting commentary on class struggle and machismo set amid the dockyards of Alexandria in the immediate aftermath of Egypt’s 1952 revolution, this feverish social-realist melodrama stars the great Omar Sharif in one of his earliest film roles. He delivers an intense performance as Ragab, a sailor who must leave behind his beloved Hamidah (Faten Hamama, at the time Sharif’s real-life wife) for a long voyage at sea. When he returns after three years and discovers that she has taken up with the wealthy Mamdouh (the heartthrob Ahmed Ramzy), the volatile Ragab fights to win her back."

Shot in 1920 in the Wichita Mountains of southwest Oklahoma with a cast entirely made up of members of the Comanche and Kiowa tribes, THE DAUGHTER OF DAWN screened publicly only twice before disappearing without a trace for nearly a century. Rediscovered and restored, this large-scale vision of Comanche and Kiowa life is a revelation. The story, played by a sprawling cast of three hundred Native Americans, includes a romantic rivalry, buffalo hunts, a battle, village scenes, dances, deceit, courage, hand-to-hand combat, and even a happy ending. The Indigenous actors, who in 1920 had been living on reservations for less than sixty years, brought with them their own tipis, horses, clothing, and material culture.

In 1902, a multigenerational family in the Gullah community on the Sea Islands off of South Carolina—former West African slaves who carried on many of their ancestors’ Yoruba traditions—struggle to maintain their cultural heritage and folklore while contemplating a migration to the mainland, even further from their roots. Awash in gorgeously poetic, sun-dappled images at once dreamlike and precise, DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST forges a radical new visual language rooted in black femininity and the rituals of Gullah culture."

From his secluded home and painting studio in the Hollywood Hills, a candid Lynch conjures people and places from his past, from his boyhood to his experiences at art school to the beginnings of his filmmaking career—in stories that unfold like scenes from his movies. This remarkable documentary by Jon Nguyen, Rick Barnes, and Olivia Neergaard-Holm travels back to Lynch’s early years as a painter and director drawn to the phantasmagoric, while also illuminating his enduring commitment to what he calls “the art life”: “You drink coffee, you smoke cigarettes, and you paint, and that’s it.”"

This bittersweet film from Jean Renoir, based on a story by Guy de Maupassant, is a tenderly comic idyll about a city family’s picnic in the French countryside and the romancing of the mother and grown daughter by two local men. Conceived as a short feature, the project had nearly finished production in 1936 when Renoir was called away for THE LOWER DEPTHS. Shooting was abandoned then, but the film was completed with the existing footage by Renoir’s team and released in its current form in 1946, after the director had already moved on to Hollywood. The result is a warmly humanist vignette that ranks among Renoir’s most lyrical works, with a love for nature imbuing its every beautiful frame."

Anna, the young second wife of a well respected but much older pastor, falls in love with her stepson when he returns to their small seventeenth-century village. Stepping outside the bounds of the village&#39;s harsh moral code has disastrous results. Exquisitely photographed and passionately acted, Day of Wrath remains an intense, unforgettable experience."

The breakthrough sophomore feature by Wong Kar Wai represents the first full flowering of his swooning signature style. The initial entry in a loosely connected, ongoing cycle that includes IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE and 2046, this ravishing existential reverie is a dreamlike drift through the Hong Kong of the 1960s in which a band of wayward twentysomethings—including a disaffected playboy (Leslie Cheung Kwok Wing) searching for his birth mother, a lovelorn woman (Maggie Cheung Man Yuk) hopelessly enamored with him, and a policeman (Andy Lau Tak Wah) caught in the middle of their turbulent relationship—pull together and push apart in a dance of frustrated desire. The director’s inaugural collaboration with both cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who lends the film its gorgeously gauzy, hallucinatory texture, and actor Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who appears briefly in a tantalizing teaser for a never-realized sequel, DAYS OF BEING WILD is an exhilarating first expression of Wong’s trademark themes of time, longing, dislocation, and the restless search for human connection."

Accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) has hardly arrived in the godforsaken outpost of Machine before he&#39;s caught in the middle of a fatal lovers&#39; quarrel. Wounded and on the lam, Blake falls under the watch of the outcast Nobody (Gary Farmer), who guides his companion on a spiritual journey, teaching him to dispense poetic justice along the way.

Upper-class geometry professor Juan and his wealthy, married mistress, Maria José, driving back from a late-night rendezvous, accidentally hit a cyclist, and run. The resulting, exquisitely shot tale of guilt, infidelity, and blackmail reveals the wide gap between the rich and the poor in Spain, and surveys the corrupt ethics of a society seduced by decadence. Juan Antonio Bardem’s charged melodrama DEATH OF A CYCLIST (MUERTE DE UN CICLISTA) was a direct attack on 1950s Spanish society under Franco’s rule. Though it was affected by the dictates of censorship, its sting could never be dulled."

Starring Nieves Navarro, Peter Martell, Claudie Lange

Luciano Ercoli’s DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT is arguably the director’s masterpiece—thanks in no small part to the screenwriting talents of giallo master Ernesto Gastaldi (TORSO). Nieves Navarro stars as Valentina, a model who, in the midst of a drug-fueled photoshoot, witnesses a brutal murder in the apartment opposite hers. But when the authorities refuse to believe that a crime has been committed, Valentina is forced to assume the role of amateur sleuth in order to unravel the mystery. Although Ercoli only made a small number of giallo films during his time as director, DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT—with its ultrastylized set pieces and grisly murder sequences—would serve to forever cement his reputation within the genre."

Part human drama, part sci-fi cautionary tale, Bertrand Tavernier’s DEATH WATCH unfolds in a future where death by disease has become extremely rare. When it is discovered that Katherine (Romy Schneider, in one of her final roles) has an incurable illness, she becomes an object of intense media fascination—so much so that Roddy (Harvey Keitel) has a camera implanted into his brain so that he can record, unbeknownst to Katherine, her final days for the reality television series “Death Watch.” By turns moving and unsettling, this cult classic is a chillingly prescient vision of a voyeuristic society in decay."

With the final installment of her DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION trilogy, Penelope Spheeris focuses on the gutter-punk lifestyle of homeless teenagers in Los Angeles. Turning her attention away from the famous musicians profiled in the first two films of the trilogy and toward their fans on the margins of society, Spheeris plumbs the comedy and the tragedy of characters who live by Johnny Rotten’s “No Future” mantra."

Featuring Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, Poison, and members of Aerosmith, Kiss, and Motörhead, as well as performances by Megadeth, Faster Pussycat, Lizzy Borden, London, Odin, and Seduce, this raucous and entertaining chapter chronicles the lonely naiveté of the striving bands, the endless flow of alcohol and drugs, and the relentless sexism endemic to the scene."

Breaking down barriers of expression and social mores, these Los Angeles punks opposed everything, giving birth to an antiestablishment view of the world that permeates today’s music, politics, social attitudes, styles, and trends. Spheeris’s film documents their deliberate reaction to the mass commercialism of music. Still burgeoning at the time, many of the punk bands first seen here have since become legendary."

Kazuo Hara’s interest in iconoclastic figures living in opposition to mainstream society led him to begin work on A DEDICATED LIFE, an intimate, fly-on-the-wall portrait of the controversial writer Mitsuharu Inoue, a sometimes charming, sometimes combative, often frustrating novelist esteemed as one of postwar Japan’s literary lions. The project, however, soon spins off into unexpected directions, first when Inoue is diagnosed with terminal cancer, then when Hara begins to discover that the writer’s talents for fiction extend to his own life, the details of which he has been fabricating for decades. As the ailing author confronts his mortality and races to complete his final works, Hara begins digging into Inoue’s past in an attempt to separate the man from the myth, resulting in a unique, layered portrait of a complex figure whose very life was an extension of his art."

In 1940s Mexico, a lusty, hot-for–Charles Boyer nurse (Regina Orozco) meets a balding con man (Daniel Giménez Cacho) who’s touchy about his toupee through a lonely hearts ad, and it’s not long before they’re off on a cross-country crime spree robbing and murdering widows in between bouts of carnal passion.

The vivid setting is a little-seen, little-known Memphis, a city where kids get through their nights by drinking and doing drugs and gay men struggle with questions of personal identity and fulfillment.

Nielsen plays Diane de Monx, a Volf Corporation executive turned spy for rival Mangatronics in the companies’ battle over the lucrative market of internet adult animation. But Diane may not be the only player at Volf with a hidden agenda: both romantic interest Hervé (Charles Berling) and office enemy Elise (Chloë Sevigny) seem to know her secret and can easily use it against her for their own purposes. As the stakes grow higher and Diane ventures into deadlier territory, Assayas explores the connections between multinational businesses and extreme underground media as well as the many ways twenty-first-century reality increasingly resembles violent, disorienting fiction."

“My sickness is that I see clearly.” Robert Bresson’s most controversial film (the French government banned viewers under the age of eighteen from seeing it, believing it would incite a rash of youth suicides) follows the journey of alienated teenager Charles (Antoine Monnier) as he searches for meaning in everything from religion and radical politics to drugs and psychoanalysis. Ultimately, all that may be left is the embrace of death. Made when the director was nearing eighty, this despairing yet undeniably resonant post–May ’68 manifesto is his deeply personal vision of the modern world as a spiritual wasteland, complete with footage of environmental degradation and nuclear destruction. No less an authority than Richard Hell declared it “by far the most punk movie ever made.”"

Ingmar Bergman&#39;s 1960 fantasy-comedy follows a reincarnated Don Juan on his assignment from the Devil, to seduce a country parson&#39;s young daughter, tarnishing her purity and shattering her faith in love.

The first in a trilogy of historical epics by director František Vláčil (followed by the renowned MARKETA LAZAROVÁ and THE VALLEY OF THE BEES), THE DEVIL’S TRAP unfolds in sixteenth-century Bohemia, where a successful miller (Vítězslav Vejražka) sees his life shattered when he is accused of being in league with Satan by a jealous regent and a fanatical priest. Setting haunting images to a powerful score by composer Zdeněk Liška, Vláčil fashions a potent reflection on the eternal conflict between faith and reason."

Starring Antonythasan Jesuthasan, Kalieaswari Srinivasan, Claudine Vinasithamby

With this Palme d’Or–winning drama, which deftly combines seemingly disparate genres, French filmmaker Jacques Audiard cemented his status as a titan of contemporary world cinema. In an arresting performance, the nonprofessional actor Antonythasan Jesuthasan (himself a former child soldier) stars as a Tamil fighter who, along with a woman and a child posing as his wife and daughter, flees war-torn Sri Lanka only to land in a Paris suburb blighted by drugs. As the makeshift family embarks on a new life, DHEEPAN settles into an intimate social-realist mode before tightening into a dynamic turf-war thriller, as well as an unsettling study of the psychological aftereffects of combat. Searing and sensitive, Audiard’s film is a unique depiction of the refugee experience as a continuous crisis of identity."

Before PSYCHO, PEEPING TOM, and REPULSION, there was DIABOLIQUE. This thriller from Henri-Georges Clouzot, which shocked audiences in Europe and the U.S., is the story of two women, the fragile wife and the willful mistress of the sadistic headmaster of a boys’ boarding school, who hatch a daring revenge plot. With its unprecedented narrative twists and terrifying images, DIABOLIQUE is a heart-grabbing benchmark in horror filmmaking, featuring outstanding performances by Simone Signoret, Véra Clouzot, and Paul Meurisse."

With this simultaneously harrowing and lyrical debut feature, Jan Němec established himself as the most uncompromising visionary among the radical filmmakers who made up the Czechoslovak New Wave. Adapted from a novel by Arnošt Lustig, DIAMONDS OF THE NIGHT closely tracks two boys who escape from a concentration-camp transport and flee into the surrounding woods, hostile terrain where the brute realities of survival coexist with dreams, memories, and fragments of visual poetry. Along with visceral camera work by Jaroslav Kučera and Miroslav Ondříček—two of Czechoslovak cinema’s most influential cinematographers—Němec makes inventive use of fractured editing, elliptical storytelling, and flights of surrealism as he strips context away from this bare-bones tale, evoking the panicked delirium of consciousness lost in night and fog."

Starring Czinkóczi Zsuzsa, Jan Nowicki, Anna Polony

One of Hungary’s most acclaimed filmmakers, Márta Mészáros, drew on her own wartime experiences to craft this haunting portrait of a young woman coming of age at a turbulent historical moment. After losing her father in the Stalinist purges, strong-willed teenager Juli (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi) is brought back to Hungary to live with Magda (Anna Polony), a rigid Communist Party official who embodies the icy intellectual repression that has begun to take hold in the country. As she navigates an unfamiliar new world—one caught between the shock of World War II and the rising tide of Stalinism—Juli must fight to retain her sense of self. Winner of the Grand Prix at Cannes, DIARY FOR MY CHILDREN is a heartrending personal testimony from an artist revisiting the traumas of the past with a clear and critical eye."

Márta Mészáros’s follow-up to DIARY FOR MY CHILDREN picks up the story of teenage Juli (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi), the director’s alter ego, as she defies the wishes of her Stalinist aunt (Anna Polony) and leaves Hungary in order to pursue her dream of becoming a filmmaker in Moscow. There, Juli must navigate the bureaucratic propaganda machine that demands she conform to its ideas of “realism” while searching desperately for her missing father. Interweaving its heroine’s journey with the political upheavals of the postwar Eastern Bloc—from the death of Stalin to the short-lived promise of liberalization to the 1956 Hungarian Uprising—DIARY FOR MY LOVERS is a stirring depiction of a young woman finding her voice in a world intent on stifling it."

The heartrending third installment of Márta Mészáros’s autobiographical Diary series continues to trace the journey of Juli (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi), a young orphan, through the tumult of postwar Hungary. Set in the wake of the failed 1956 Hungarian revolution, DIARY FOR MY MOTHER AND FATHER follows Juli as she leaves film school in Moscow and returns home to Budapest, where she discovers a shattered world in which brutality, fear, and anxiety permeate every aspect of life as Soviet forces tighten their grip on power. Seamlessly interweaving documentary newsreel footage with stirring human drama, Mészáros creates an at once epic and intimate portrait of history as she experienced it, bearing witness to both the horrors of totalitarian oppression and the courage of those who resist."

In his claustrophobic mod home, he pampers his pill-popping wife, seduces his maid, and uncovers a gun that may have once been owned by John Dillinger—and then things get even stranger. A surreal political missive about social malaise, DILLINGER IS DEAD (DILLINGER È MORTO) finds absurdity in the mundane. It is a singular experience, both illogical and grandly existential."

Deceptively simple in form and content, Jean Eustache’s A DIRTY STORY is a fascinatingly complex investigation of the relationship between fiction and documentary, verbal and visual storytelling, and personal and universal desires. The film’s two sections mirror each other: in the first, Michael Lonsdale performs the role of a man explaining to a roomful of friends his past voyeuristic obsessions, while the second section shows an unscripted recording of Jean-Noël Picq, the man Lonsdale plays, recounting the same real-life tale. Eustache presents dramatic and authentic versions of the “dirty story” without authorial commentary and thus encourages the viewer to untangle a web of structural correspondences between the narrations, as well as the sexual and moral implications of Picq’s candid confession."

Droll comedy of manners and morals that was based on a play and made as a film once before in 1932 as COUNSEL&#39;S OPINION, directed by Allan Dwan. The four screenwriters&#39; literate script of Biro&#39;s adaptation of the stage work takes Oberon to a London hotel where she is attending a costume party. The weather turns foul and she must spend the night at the hostelry with several other ladies who were unable to make it home. Olivier is a young lawyer occupying a suite and the manager prevails on him to give up some of the space in his copious quarters, but Olivier is adamant until Oberon uses her wiles on him. The result is that she gets the comfortable bed and Olivier must snooze on the floor in the next room. In the morning, she leaves before he can find out anything about this fascinating and attractive woman. Her alacrity causes him to wonder if she&#39;s married. When he arrives at his office, an old school chum contacts him and wants Olivier to handle his divorce. The man is sure his wife spent the night with another man at the same hotel we&#39;ve seen earlier. Olivier can&#39;t believe this nerd could be married to Oberon. He isn&#39;t, of course, and his wife is someone else entirely. But Olivier doesn&#39;t know that yet. So it gets down to one of those British drawing-room farces where identities are mistaken, accusations are made, absurd situations occur, and Olivier and Oberon are together at the finale. Richardson is very funny as the man who wants a divorce from wife Barnes, who has been married thrice before and has backhanded fidelity on many other occasions. Oberon shows she can play light comedy as well as some of the heavier work she had to do over the years. The Technicolor tinting was supervised by long-time advisor Natalie Kalmus and, although it lent a nice air to the already-airy material, it was totally unnecessary."

Bob Dylan is captured on-screen as he never would be again in this groundbreaking film from D. A. Pennebaker. The legendary documentarian finds Dylan in England during his 1965 tour, which would be his last as an acoustic artist. In this wildly entertaining vision of one of the twentieth century’s greatest artists, Dylan is surrounded by teen fans, gets into heated philosophical jousts with journalists, and kicks back with fellow musicians Joan Baez, Donovan, and Alan Price. Featuring some of Dylan’s most famous songs, including “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” and “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” DONT LOOK BACK is a radically conceived portrait of an American icon that has influenced decades of vérité behind-the-scenes documentaries."

Melvin Van Peebles’s film version of his own Tony Award–nominated Broadway musical is a bold blend of theater and nervy, New Wave–inflected cinematic invention. A cast of Black stage and screen luminaries including Esther Rolle, Mabel King, and Avon Long stars in this charmingly offbeat, fablelike fantasy in which a pair of mischief-making devil-bats dispatched by Satan assume human form in order to wreak havoc on a Saturday-night house party in Harlem—only to find their diabolical plan thwarted by their hosts’ infectious generosity of spirit. Staged with ebullience, the original blues- and gospel-infused songs by Van Peebles burst forth in a life-affirming celebration of Black joy, tenderness, resilience, and strength."

From Lucio Fulci, the Godfather of Gore, comes one of the most powerful and unsettling giallo thrillers ever produced. When the sleepy rural village of Accendura is rocked by a series of murders of young boys, the superstitious locals are quick to assign blame, with the suspects including the local “witch” Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). With the bodies piling up and the community gripped by a thirst for bloody vengeance, two outsiders—city journalist Andrea (Tomas Milian) and spoiled rich girl Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet)—team up to crack the case. Deemed shocking at the time for its brutal violence, depiction of the Catholic Church, and themes of child murder and pedophilia, DON’T TORTURE A DUCKLING pushes the envelope of terror."

Teresa Sánchez (winner of a Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival) delivers an astonishing performance as María García, the owner of Dos Estaciones, a formerly majestic tequila factory now struggling to stay afloat. The factory is the final holdover from generations of Mexican-owned tequila plants in the highlands of Jalisco, the rest having folded to foreign corporations.

Though unknown to each other, the two women share an enigmatic, emotional bond, which Kieślowski details in gorgeous reflections, colors, and movements.

Starring Toby Smith, April Barnett, Will Power

A rediscovered treasure of 1990s DIY filmmaking, Cauleen Smith’s DRYLONGSO embeds an incisive look at racial injustice within a lovingly handmade buddy movie/murder mystery/romance. Alarmed by the rate at which the young Black men around her are dying, brash Oakland, California, art student Pica (Toby Smith) attempts to preserve their existence in Polaroid snapshots, along the way forging a friendship with a woman in an abusive relationship (April Barnett) and experiencing love, heartbreak, and the everyday threat of violence. Capturing the vibrant community spirit of Oakland in the nineties, Smith crafts both a rare cinematic celebration of Black female creativity and a moving elegy for a generation of lost African American men."

Directed by Metin Erksan • 1964 • Turkey
Starring Erol Taş, Hülya Koçyiğit, Ulvi Doğan

Winner of the prestigious Golden Bear at the 1964 Berlin International Film Festival, Metin Erksan’s wallop of a melodrama follows the machinations of an unrepentantly selfish tobacco farmer who builds a dam to prevent water from flowing downhill to his neighbors’ crops. Alongside this tale of soul-devouring competition is one of overheated desire, as a love triangle develops between the farmer, his more decent brother, and the beautiful villager the latter takes as his bride. A benchmark of Turkish cinema, this is a visceral, innovatively shot and vibrantly acted depiction of the horrors of greed.

Restored in 2008 by the Cineteca di Bologna/L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, in association with The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project, Ulvi Dogan, and Fatih Akim. Additional elements provided by the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Stiftung. Restoration funded by Armani, Cariter, Qatar Airways, and Qatar Museum Authority."

Two trailblazing women artists—filmmaker Lois Weber and Russian ballet superstar Anna Pavlova—joined forces to create this long-unseen landmark of silent cinema, the first blockbuster ever directed by a woman. Adapted from an opera by Daniel Auber, THE DUMB GIRL OF PORTICI tells the story of Fenella (Pavlova), a mute fisher girl living during the seventeenth-century Spanish occupation of Naples, who is seduced and abandoned by a Spanish nobleman. As a result of this betrayal and the oppression of their people, Fenella’s brother foments a revolution. The only feature-film performance that Pavlova left behind, this vital rediscovery offers modern viewers an invaluable chance to experience the energy, the expressive face, and the physical grace of one of the twentieth century’s most revered performers."

Adapted from the explosive one-act play by Amiri Baraka, this intense chamber drama remains as provocative today as it was in 1966. In an empty New York City subway car, a sexually audacious white woman named Lula (Shirley Knight, winner of the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival) taunts Clay (Al Freeman Jr.), a mild-mannered Black man, with mocking flirtations and increasingly offensive race-baiting. When Lula pushes him to his breaking point, Clay’s furious response appears to provide cathartic liberation—unless it portends a far more tragic fate. Baraka’s script suffuses DUTCHMAN with combative innuendo and allegorical dream logic, amplified by the tense, cinema-verité style of Anthony Harvey, a longtime editor who shot his directorial debut with fearless command, expertly excavating America’s deepest racial taboos."

Our unlikely protagonist is Cheng Yong (Xu Zheng), a middle-aged, deadbeat Shanghai shopkeeper who sees a chance to make a quick buck by smuggling a cheap, generic drug used to treat leukemia from India into China.

Starring Luca Marinelli, Alessandro Borghi, Lupo Barbiero

An epic journey of friendship and self-discovery, THE EIGHT MOUNTAINS is a landmark cinematic experience as intimate as it is monumental, as deep as it is expansive. Adapting the award-winning novel by Paolo Cognetti, directors Felix van Groeningen and Charlotte Vandermeersch (THE BROKEN CIRCLE BREAKDOWN) portray through observant detail and stunning landscape photography the profound, complex relationship between Pietro (Luca Marinelli) and Bruno (Alessandro Borghi), who first meet as children when Pietro’s Milan family vacations in an isolated village at the base of the Alpine slopes. As they mature, Pietro becomes estranged from his business-minded father (Filippo Timi) even as Bruno—emotionally abandoned by his own father—takes up the role of surrogate son. Pietro’s father’s death reunites the two in realizing his dream of constructing a cabin on the Alps, and the project and subsequent explorations of the awe-inspiring mountain range bond Pietro and Bruno in a shared purpose. Yet despite their connection, the purity of nature and the demands of society both threaten to drive the men to pursue different, possibly irrevocably divergent paths on the vertiginous terrain of life.

“Intoxicating . . . A tender story about love and friendship.”
—Manohla Dargis, The New York Times

“A stunning, often profound and frequently jaw-droppingly gorgeous tale . . . The intoxicating atmosphere of THE EIGHT MOUNTAINS is a cherished retreat I’m already eager to revisit.”

Made with a righteous political anger that anticipates the incendiary polemics of documentarians such as Michael Moore and Joshua Oppenheimer, Kazuo Hara’s most renowned film is a harrowing confrontation with one of Japanese history’s darkest chapters: the atrocities committed by the country’s military during World War II. Hara’s unforgettable subject and collaborator in THE EMPEROR’S NAKED ARMY MARCHES ON is Kenzo Okuzaki—a former soldier, convicted murderer, and defiantly anti-establishment agitator—who has made it his life’s mission to expose the crimes committed by Japanese officers against their own men while stationed in New Guinea. As the often-violent Okuzaki resorts to extreme measures in his crusade to find out the truth about what happened to two soldiers murdered by their commanders, what emerges is at once a shocking piece of investigative journalism, a courageous condemnation of militarism and blind obedience, and a riveting portrait of a single-minded man driven by a raw fury bordering on madness."

The great Sammo Hung wrote, directed, and stars in this outrageously entertaining Hong Kong cinema landmark—one of the first HK horror-comedy-action hybrids and the film that launched the hopping-vampire craze that would proliferate throughout the 1980s. He plays a fearless but naive rickshaw driver who is tricked into spending the night at a haunted temple—not knowing that the whole thing is a set up by his adulterous wife’s lover to kill him! Ghosts, zombies, and, yes, the OG hopping vampire (played by Yuen Biao) are all on hand in an eerily atmospheric showcase for Hung’s ingenious comic-action choreography."

This X-rated, cult-classic black comedy is one of the most subversive, totally nihilistic transmissions from the fringes of the 1970s New Hollywood. A daring adaptation of the novel by John Barth filtered through the counterculture sensibility of screenwriter Terry Southern, END OF THE ROAD follows college grad Jacob Horner (Stacy Keach), who, after a catatonic episode, finds himself at “The Farm,” a sanitarium presided over the very, very unorthodox Doctor D (a totally deranged James Earl Jones). Following his discharge, Horner takes a job as a professor—but an affair with a colleague’s wife has disastrous consequences."

We watch as ten-year-old François (Michel Terrazon) is shuttled from one home to another, his behavior growing increasingly erratic, his bonds with his surrogate parents perennially fraught. In this, his feature debut, Pialat treats that potentially sentimental scenario with astonishing sobriety and stark realism.

Elisabeth (a remarkable Nicole Stéphane) and Paul (Edouard Dermithe) close themselves off from the world by playing an increasingly intense series of mind games with the people who dare enter their lair, until romance and jealousy intrude.

“Life is a beastly mess,” states the great Laurence Olivier in this superb drama of the seedy music-hall life. He plays Archie Rice, a third-rate vaudevillian whose song-and-dance routines are crusty, unappealing, and decidedly boring. His wife (Brenda de Banzie) is a shrewish alcoholic who nags him constantly about his failures. His father (Roger Livesey), a once-famous entertainer, is dying, yet Archie prevails upon him to back just one more tawdry musical revue. Archie’s world comes tumbling down onto the garbage heap he has built up through a life of self-deception, sneaky schemes, and ruthless unconcern for those who love him. Based on the play by Angry Young Man John Osborne and directed by British New Wave trailblazer Tony Richardson, THE ENTERTAINER is built around one of Olivier’s most riveting performances."

EVERGREEN is not only the best British musical ever made, it also features the queen of the London musical stage, Jessie Matthews, in the best roles of her career. Songs by Rodgers and Hart (including their exquisite &#39;Dancing on the Ceiling&#39;) enliven this tale of an Edwardian star who, driven into retirement by her blackmailing ex-husband, is impersonated by her daughter (both are played by Matthews) in order to stage a comeback 20 years later."

Gu Jun&#39;s film for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad Beijing 2008 strikes an adroit balance between the intimate and the spectacular.

Inspired by psychologist Erik Erikson’s theories of human social development, this singular animated journey takes viewers through the eight stages of life, from birth to death. The freewheeling watercolor visuals of animators John and Faith Hubley, striking score (featuring Dizzy Gillespie), and voice work from a cast that ranges from the Hubleys’ children to Meryl Streep come together in a ride on the “carousel of life” that’s as much an educational film as it is a one-of-a-kind full-sensory experience."

Starring Isabelle Huppert, Jacques Dutronc, Nathalie Baye

After a decade in the wilds of avant-garde and early video experimentation, Jean-Luc Godard returned to commercial cinema with this star-driven work of social commentary, while remaining defiantly intellectual and formally cutting-edge. EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF, featuring a script by Jean-Claude Carrière and Anne-Marie Miéville, looks at the sexual and professional lives of three people, a television director (Jacques Dutronc), his ex-girlfriend (Nathalie Baye), and a prostitute (Isabelle Huppert), to create a meditative story about work, relationships, and the notion of freedom. Made twenty years into his career, it was, Godard said, his “second first film.”"

Luis García Berlanga’s penultimate film is a raucous screwball satire in which a prison in Valencia hosts an event recognizing the political prisoners jailed during Franco’s reign. As an oddball mix of misfits—including a toilet salesman, a mobster, a politician, and a communist priest—convene for a most unusual reunion, the proceedings quickly spiral out of control. Wild scatological humor meets sharp-edged social commentary for a caustic look at the state of post-Franco Spain that won Goya Awards for best film and director."

In a secluded, snowy mountain village, widower and single father Takumi (Hitoshi Omika) leads a modest life gathering water, wood, and wild wasabi for a friend’s udon shop. Yet this peaceful existence is threatened when a pair of corporate reps (Ryuji Kosaka and Ayaka Shibutani) arrive to launch a glamping site, sparking resistance from community members who fear the project’s potentially pernicious impact on the environment. When Takumi—a respected local figure—is offered the conciliatory role of site caretaker, it becomes unclear where his loyalties lie. EVIL DOES NOT EXIST, Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s much-anticipated follow-up to his Academy Award–winning DRIVE MY CAR, is a haunting, suspenseful meditation on humankind’s thorny relationship with nature, consumerism, and itself. Inspired by a collaboration with composer Eiko Ishibashi, the director showcases his masterful command of pacing and atmosphere to uncover the destructive forces lurking beneath the thin veneer of civilization."

As caustic today as it was in 1963, this early collaboration between Luis Garcia Berlanga and his longtime screenwriter Rafael Azcona is an unerring depiction of what Berlanga called &quot;the invisible traps that society sets up for us.&quot; A furiously funny personal attack on capital punishment, THE EXECUTIONER evaded the state censors who sought to suppress it, and today is regarded as one of the greatest Spanish films of all time."

Darker in tone than the original, EXECUTIONERS finds Johnnie To and codirector/martial-arts choreographer Ching Siu-tung continuing to push their whirlwind action set pieces to new levels of cartoon craziness, while adding an abundance of grungy, dystopian atmosphere and a fresh dose of antiauthoritarian attitude."

Swirling around them are Eric (Elias Koteas), the house DJ, who is jealousy possessive of Christina; Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian), the club’s owner, who is pregnant by Eric; and Thomas (Don McKellar), a smuggler of rare bird eggs whose activities Francis is investigating.

With no music and little dialogue, and distinguished by its darkly elegant compositions, the film offers an impressionistic meditation on adolescent solitude."

Granted at times shockingly intimate access to Miyuki’s personal life, Hara follows her wayward journey toward liberation as she explores her sexuality with both men and women, becomes pregnant and raises a family as a single mother, and grows increasingly disenchanted with the constraints of traditional social structures. A film as radical, complicated, and uncompromising as Miyuki herself, EXTREME PRIVATE EROS explodes the boundaries between subject and filmmaker to create a stunningly candid portrait of a woman willing to risk everything in her quest to live on her own terms."

Visionary cinema historian Mark Cousins (THE STORY OF FILM: AN ODYSSEY) charts the unknown territory of the imagination of one of the twentieth century’s most revolutionary artists. Granted unprecedented access to hundreds of sketches, drawings, and paintings by Orson Welles—tantalizing, never-before-seen glimpses into the filmmaker’s rich inner life—Cousins sheds new light on the experiences, dreams, desires, and obsessions that fueled his creativity and inspired his masterpieces. Playful, profound, and as daringly iconoclastic as its subject, THE EYES OF ORSON WELLES is a one-of-a-kind work of visual archaeology, a fresh way of looking at a cinematic giant whose singular worldview—fiercely humanist, defiantly antiauthoritarian—resonates now more urgently than ever."

EYES WITHOUT A FACE, directed by the supremely talented Georges Franju, is rare in horror cinema for its odd mixture of the ghastly and the lyrical, and it has been a major influence on the genre in the decades since its release.

Okuyama (YOJIMBO’s Tatsuya Nakadai), after being burned and disfigured in an industrial accident and estranged from his family and friends, agrees to his psychiatrist’s radical experiment: a face transplant, created from the mold of a stranger. As Okuyama is thus further alienated from the world around him, he finds himself giving in to his darker temptations.

Lost souls reach out for human connection amid a glimmering Hong Kong in Wong Kar Wai’s hallucinatory, neon-soaked nocturne. Originally conceived as a segment of CHUNGKING EXPRESS only to spin off on its own woozy axis, FALLEN ANGELS plays like the dark, moody flip side of its predecessor as it charts the subtly interlacing fates of a handful of urban loners, including a coolly detached hit man (Leon Lai Ming) looking to go straight; his business partner (Michelle Reis), who secretly yearns for him; and a mute delinquent (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who wreaks mischief by night. Swinging between hard-boiled noir and slapstick lunacy with giddy abandon, the film is both a dizzying, dazzling city symphony and a poignant meditation on love, loss, and longing in a metropolis that never sleeps."

The result—the tale of two lazy cousins (Chan and Austin Wai Tin-chi) who join forces to avenge the deaths of their fathers—may not be pure Chan, but there are plenty of loony pleasures (including our hero fighting an adversary with his feet!) to be had."

Starring Jackie Chan, James Tien, Yen Shi-kwan

An auteur emerges as Jackie Chan—working for the first time as director, in addition to serving as cowriter, lead actor, and martial-arts choreographer—takes full charge of his on-screen image. Perfecting the archetypal Chan character, he stars here as a rapscallion student of his martial-arts-master grandfather (Hong Kong cinema legend James Tien) who uses his kung-fu prowess to fight challengers for money—until a personal tragedy forces him to get serious. Experimenting with various lenses and camera setups, Chan maximizes the action’s visual impact, while unleashing some of his most innovative fight choreography in a stunning, whirlwind display of “emotional kung fu.”"

Before WOODSTOCK and MONTEREY POP, there was FESTIVAL.

Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Howlin’ Wolf, Johnny Cash, the Staple Singers, Pete Seeger, Son House, and Peter, Paul and Mary were just a few of the legends who shared the stage at Newport, treating audiences to a range of folk music that encompassed the genre’s roots in blues, country, and gospel as well as its newer flirtations with rock and roll. Shooting in gorgeous black and white, Lerner juxtaposes performances with snapshot interviews with artists and their fans, weaving footage from four years of the festival into an intimate record of a pivotal time in music—and in American culture at large."

Trickery. Deceit. Magic. In F FOR FAKE, a free-form sort-of documentary by Orson Welles, the legendary filmmaker (and self-described charlatan) gleefully reengages with the central preoccupation of his career: the tenuous lines between illusion and truth, art and lies. Beginning with portraits of the world-renowned art forger Elmyr de Hory and his equally devious biographer, Clifford Irving, Welles embarks on a dizzying journey that simultaneously exposes and revels in fakery and fakers of all stripes, not the least of whom is Welles himself. Charming and inventive, F FOR FAKE is an inspired prank and a clever examination of the essential duplicity of cinema."

Nobel Prize–winning author Samuel Beckett’s lone work for projected cinema is, in essence, a chase film, arguably the craziest ever committed to celluloid. It’s a chase between camera and pursued image that finds existential dread embedded in the very apparatus of the movies. The link to cinema’s essence is evident in the casting, as the chased object is none other than an aged Buster Keaton, who was understandably befuddled at Beckett and director Alan Schneider’s instruction that he keep his face hidden from the camera’s gaze. Commissioned and produced by Grove Press’s Barney Rosset and exquisitely shot by Academy Award–winning cinematographer Boris Kaufman, FILM is the unique product of an all-star assembly of talent and a cinematic conundrum that asks more questions than it answers."

A hilarious saga of good intentions confounded, the story chronicles a firemen’s ball where nothing goes right, from a beauty pageant whose reluctant participants embarrass the organizers to a lottery from which nearly all the prizes are pilfered.

Youthful idealism collides with matter-of-fact violence in a working-class Bronx neighborhood in the early 1960s in this captivatingly offbeat urban mosaic featuring an extraordinary ensemble cast. A woman (Jodie Foster) being stalked by a psychotic ex-con (John Turturro). A young man (Tim Robbins) whose pacifist ideals compel him to get involved in the civil rights movement. A schoolteacher mysteriously murdered by a bow and arrow. And a kidnapped penguin. These are just some of the seemingly unrelated stories that gradually intertwine in a rich, utterly unique slice of life from the pen of Pulitzer Prize–winning writer John Patrick Shanley (MOONSTRUCK, DOUBT)."

Starring Shin Saburi, Michiyo Kogure, Keiko Tsushima

One of the ineffably lovely domestic sagas made by Yasujiro Ozu at the height of his mastery, THE FLAVOR OF GREEN TEA OVER RICE is a sublimely piercing portrait of a marriage coming quietly undone. Secrets and deceptions strain the already tenuous relationship of a childless, middle-aged couple, as the wife’s city-bred sophistication bumps up against the husband’s small-town simplicity, and a generational sea change—in the form of her headstrong, modern niece—sweeps over their household. The director’s abiding concern with family dynamics receives one of its most spirited treatments, with a wry, tender humor and buoyant expansiveness that moves the action from the home into the baseball stadiums, pachinko parlors, and ramen shops of postwar Tokyo."

When filmmaker Chris Wilcha revisits the record store he worked at as a teenager in New Jersey, he finds the once-thriving bastion of music and weirdness from his youth slowly falling apart and out of touch with the times. FLIPSIDE documents his tragicomic attempt to revive the store while revisiting other documentary projects he has abandoned over the years. In the process, Wilcha captures “This American Life” host Ira Glass in the midst of a creative rebirth, discovers the origin story of David Bowie’s ode to a local New Jersey cable-television hero, and uncovers the unlikely connection between jazz photographer Herman Leonard and TV writer David Milch. This disparate collection of stories coheres into something strange and expansive—a moving meditation on music, work, and the sacrifices and satisfaction of trying to live a creative life."

“Short is the life of flowers, infinite their sorrows . . .” Director Mikio Naruse’s most famous film in Japan is a haunting portrait of obsessive love in a ruined world. Set amid the bombed-out landscapes of postwar Japan, FLOATING CLOUDS stars the director’s frequent collaborator, the heartbreaking Hideko Takamine, as a woman who returns from working in French Indochina with hopes of resuming her relationship with a married man (Masayuki Mori) with whom she had an affair—leading them both into a self-destructive spiral of hurt and anger. Drifting dreamily in and out of present reality and memories, it builds with quiet force toward one of Naruse’s most exquisitely devastating finales."

In 1959, Yasujiro Ozu remade his 1934 silent classic A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS in color with the celebrated cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa (RASHOMON, UGETSU). Setting his later version in a seaside location, Ozu otherwise preserves the details of his elegantly simple plot wherein an aging actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his former lover and illegitimate son, a scenario that enrages his current mistress and results in heartbreak for all. Together, the films offer a unique glimpse into the evolution of one of cinema’s greatest directors. A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS reveals Ozu in the midst of developing his mode of expression; FLOATING WEEDS reveals his distinct style at its pinnacle. In each, the director captures the joy and sadness in everyday life."

An intoxicating, time-bending experience bathed in the golden glow of oil lamps and wreathed in an opium haze, this gorgeous period reverie by Hou Hsiao-hsien traces the romantic intrigue, jealousies, and tensions swirling around four late-nineteenth-century Shanghai “flower houses,” where courtesans live confined to a gilded cage, ensconced in opulent splendor but forced to work to buy back their freedom. Among the regular clients is the taciturn Master Wang (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), whose relationship with his longtime mistress (Michiko Hada) is roiled by a perceived act of betrayal. Composed in a languorous procession of entrancing long takes, FLOWERS OF SHANGHAI evokes a vanished world of decadence and cruelty, an insular universe where much of the dramatic action remains tantalizingly offscreen—even as its emotional fallout registers with quiet devastation."

Though REBECCA prevailed, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT is the more quintessential Hitch film. A full-throttle espionage thriller, starring Joel McCrea as a green Yank reporter sent to Europe to get the scoop on the imminent war, it’s wall-to-wall witty repartee, head-spinning plot twists, and brilliantly mounted suspense set pieces, including an ocean plane crash climax with astonishing special effects.

Despite the turbulent sociopolitical backdrop, Leigh focuses instead on the small, everyday moments that both connect and separate these four parents-to-be, creating a profoundly human, strikingly naturalistic look at life on both sides of a bitter religious and political divide."

This Technicolor spectacular, directed by Zoltán Korda, is considered the finest of the many adaptations of A. E. W. Mason’s classic 1902 adventure novel about the British empire’s exploits in Africa, and a crowning achievement of Alexander Korda’s legendary production company, London Films. Set at the end of the nineteenth century, THE FOUR FEATHERS follows the travails of a young officer (John Clements) accused of cowardice after he resigns his post on the eve of a major deployment to Khartoum; he must then fight to redeem himself in the eyes of his fellow officers (including Ralph Richardson) and fiancée (June Duprez). Featuring music by Miklós Rózsa and Oscar-nominated cinematography by Georges Périnal and Osmond Borradaile, THE FOUR FEATHERS is a thrilling, thunderous epic."

A lottery win leads not to financial and emotional freedom but to social captivity, in this wildly cynical classic about love and exploitation by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Casting himself against type, the director plays a suggestible working-class innocent who lets himself be taken advantage of by his bourgeois new boyfriend and his circle of materialistic friends, leading to the kind of resonant misery that only Fassbinder could create.

In a series of escalating “games,” the sadistic duo subject their victims to unspeakable physical and psychological torture over the course of a night. A home-invasion thriller in which the genre’s threat of bloodshed is made stomach-churningly real, the film ratchets up shocks even as its executioners interrupt the action to address the audience, drawing queasy attention to the way that cinema milks pleasure from pain and stokes our appetite for atrocity.

Following a car accident, a megawealthy businessman (José Luis López Vázquez) is left paralyzed and with no memory of who he is or of anything connected to his previous life—including the number to a certain secret Swiss bank account. Determined to get their hands on his fortune, his greedy family members resort to extreme measures in order to coax his memories back. In the hands of director Carlos Saura, this rich setup becomes a comic, caustic, and surreal metaphor for the psychic suffering endured by Spanish citizens under fascism."

In 1974, Barbet Schroeder went to Uganda to make a film about Idi Amin, the country’s ruthless, charismatic dictator. Three years into a murderous regime that would be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans, Amin prepared a triumphal greeting for the filmmakers, staging rallies, military maneuvers, and cheery displays of national pride, and envisioning the film as an official portrait to adorn his cult of personality. Schroeder, however, had other ideas, emerging with a disquieting, caustically funny brief against Amin, in which the dictator’s own endless stream of testimony—by turns charming, menacing, and nonsensical—serves as the most damning evidence. A revelatory tug-of-war between subject and filmmaker, GENERAL IDI AMIN DADA: A SELF-PORTRAIT is a landmark in the art of documentary and an appalling study of egotism in power."

But he also recorded a personal film diary, shot on Kodachrome, of the events he witnessed, amassing reels of long-unseen color footage that his son, George Stevens Jr., later assembled into this invaluable documentary, featuring firsthand accounts from screenwriter Ivan Moffat. Capturing everything from the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the liberation of Paris to the horrors of Dachau and the bombed-out ravages of Berlin, this remarkable slice of history offers a look in vivid color at some of the most consequential moments of the twentieth century and tells the gripping story of a combat camera unit at war."

Jim Jarmusch combined his love for the ice-cool crime dramas of Jean-Pierre Melville and Seijun Suzuki with the philosophical dimensions of samurai mythology for an eccentrically postmodern take on the hit-man thriller. In one of his defining roles, Forest Whitaker brings a commanding serenity to his portrayal of a Zen contract killer working for a bumbling mob outfit, a modern man who adheres steadfastly to the ideals of the Japanese warrior code even as chaos and violence spiral around him. Featuring moody cinematography by the great Robby Müller, a sublime score by the Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA, and a host of colorful character actors (including a memorably stone-faced Henry Silva), GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI plays like a pop-culture-sampling cinematic mixtape built around a one-of-a-kind tragic hero."

Mai Zetterling’s cinema reached new heights of exuberant experimentation and fierce political engagement with this pointed and playful touchstone of 1960s feminist cinema. As they tour Sweden in a theatrical production of “Lysistrata,” performing to often uncomprehending audiences, three women (national cinema icons Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson, and Gunnel Lindblom) find their own lives and marriages mirrored in the complex, combative gender relations at the heart of Aristophanes’s play.

Agnès Varda’s extraordinary late-career renaissance began with this wonderfully idiosyncratic, self-reflexive documentary in which the French cinema icon explores the world of modern-day gleaners: those living on the margins who survive by foraging for what society throws away. Embracing the intimacy and freedom of digital filmmaking, Varda posits herself as a kind of gleaner of images and ideas, one whose generous, expansive vision makes room for ruminations on everything from aging to the birth of cinema to the beauty of heart-shaped potatoes. By turns playful, philosophical, and subtly political, THE GLEANERS AND I is a warmly human reflection on the contradictions of our consumerist world from an artist who, like her subjects, finds unexpected richness where few think to look."

Agnès Varda’s charming follow-up to her acclaimed documentary THE GLEANERS AND I is a deceptively unassuming grace note that takes us deeper into the world of those who find purpose and beauty in the refuse of society. Revisiting many of the original film’s subjects to explore the often unexpected effects that their participation in the project has had on their lives, this wonderfully warm and human epilogue once again takes gleaning as the starting point from which to explore what most interests Varda: the richness, complexity, and poignancy of life outside the mainstream. What emerges is a crazy-quilt tapestry of the personal, the political, and the esoteric that celebrates the spirit and creativity of those who forge their own path."

The struggle between the strictures of religion and our own brute animal nature plays out amid the beautifully forbidding landscapes of remote Iceland in this stunning psychological epic from director Hlynur Pálmason. In the late nineteenth century, Danish priest Lucas (Elliott Crosset Hove) makes the perilous trek to Iceland’s southeastern coast with the intention of establishing a church. There, the arrogant man of God finds his resolve tested as he confronts the harsh terrain, temptations of the flesh, and the reality of being an intruder in an unforgiving land. What unfolds is a transfixing journey into the heart of colonial darkness attuned to both the majesty and terrifying power of the natural world.

The exuberant enchantments of the singing, dancing musical meet the feminist, formalist sensibility of cinematic visionary Chantal Akerman in this uniquely captivating vision of love and survival in the age of late capitalism. Amid the consumerist wonderland of a shopping mall, a cadre of store employees bounce in and out of one another’s arms in a cycle of breakups, makeups, misunderstandings, and reunions, their romantic roundelay punctuated by imaginatively stylized production numbers. Working with frequent star Delphine Seyrig and a remarkable team of writers—who between them penned everything from JULES AND JIM to DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN—Akerman deftly balances the shiny pop pleasures of the genre with piercing variations on her signature themes, including a startlingly moving reflection on Jewish resilience and the legacy of the Holocaust."

An early documentary to portray the experiences of disabled people with compassion and complexity, Kazuo Hara’s searing debut is also one of the most unflinching films ever made about what it means to be an outsider. Produced in collaboration with the Green Lawn—a group of activists with cerebral palsy who work to raise awareness of the condition—GOODBYE CP blends jagged, shot-on-the-fly footage of the members’ seemingly Sisyphean struggle to take their message to the streets with raw, sometimes confrontational interviews in which they reveal the torment of living in a society cruelly indifferent to their existence. In making his subjects active participants in the film’s creation—a practice he would continue throughout his career—Hara powerfully asserts the humanity and agency of those who have long been denied both."

A lighthearted take on director Yasujiro Ozu’s perennial theme of the challenges of inter­generational relationships, GOOD MORNING tells the story of two young boys who stop speaking in protest after their parents refuse to buy a television set. Ozu weaves a wealth of subtle gags through a family portrait as rich as those of his dramatic films, mocking the foibles of the adult world through the eyes of his child protagonists. Shot in stunning color and set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new washing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door salesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I WAS BORN, BUT . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan."

To lend the film a caustic bite, he interspersed these harrowing images with scenes of a London cocktail party’s mundane chatter—daring viewers to continue to treat such horrors as abstract.

A screenwriter who had worked with Hitchcock on such films as THE LADY VANISHES and JAMAICA INN, Gilliat slyly upends whodunit conventions with wit and style."

Twist","United States,","1951","Directed by Derek N. Twist • 1951 • United Kingdom

The British film industry was in deep trouble in the late 1940s, sufficient to justify the craft unions themselves working to secure some production for their members -- one result was Green Grow The Rushes (1951), a comedy directed by Derek Twist and starring Richard Burton, Roger Livesey (The Life And Death of Colonel Blimp, I Know Where I&#39;m Going), and Honor Blackman (Goldfinger, The Avengers, A Night To Remember). The plot is a piercing look at postwar Britain, and efforts to move the nation into the modern age -- that doesn&#39;t sit well with the people of Anderia Marsh, who have claimed a right (going back to Henry III) to evade government-imposed import duties and taxes. And when the government decides to curb this right, the whole village quietly rises up in a comical rebellion."

Starring Marie Rivière, María Luisa García, Vincent Gauthier

Eric Rohmer captures the ache of summertime sadness with exquisite poignancy in this luminous tale of self-exploration. The Jules Verne novel of the same name provides the loose inspiration for the story of Delphine (Marie Rivière), a dreamy, introverted young secretary who, reeling from a breakup with her boyfriend, faces the anxiety-inducing prospect of spending her summer vacation alone. As she bounces from a getaway in Cherbourg to the tourist-choked Alps to the sunny beaches of Biarritz, Delphine passes through a whirl of social activity—but through it all remains profoundly alone, searching for the true human connection that seems to perpetually elude her. As honest a portrait of loneliness, depression, and the longing for understanding as has ever been committed to film, THE GREEN RAY stands as one of the most piercingly perceptive works by the French cinema’s keenest observer of human relationships."

The two manage to thrive together amid the decay and disorder of their East Hampton, New York, mansion, making for an eerily ramshackle echo of the American Camelot.

Starring Steve Cochran, Alida Valli, Dorian Gray

Years before his international breakthrough L’AVVENTURA, Michelangelo Antonioni made his first masterpiece with IL GRIDO, a raw expression of anguish that remains one of Italian cinema’s great overlooked gems. Bridging the director’s early, neorealism-inspired work and his hallmark stories of existential rootlessness, Il grido centers on Aldo (Steve Cochran), a sugar-refinery worker in the Po valley, whose hopes of marrying his longtime lover (Alida Valli) are dashed when she declares she’s fallen in love with another man. Shocked and demoralized, Aldo leaves town with his daughter, drifting through the Po’s small villages as his prospects dwindle and his connections with other women—including an an old girlfriend (Betsy Blair), a gas-station owner (Dorian Gray), and a sex worker (Lyn Shaw)—fizzle out into alienation and despair. Boldly using environment to convey character, IL GRIDO reveals a director in the process of discovering his artistic signature and applying it to this most personal of statements about the human condition."

In true Leigh fashion, things come to a head in a climax that is brilliantly funny and heartbreaking at the same time."

Starring Thierno Ndiaye Doss, Mame Ndoumbé Diop, Myriam Niang

“Guelwaar” is the nickname of Pierre Henri Thioune (Thierno Ndiaye), a political radical and agitator whose criticism of Senegal’s reliance on foreign aid ruffles the feathers of the powers-that-be. His suspicious death is followed by a farcical mix-up when his corpse is mistaken for that of another man and accidentally interred in an Islamic cemetery. Guelwaar’s family, led by Europeanized son Barthelemy (Ndiawar Diop), enlists the local police to unearth and then rebury their paterfamilias on Catholic ground, but Muslim resistance sparks a religious conflict and unleashes long held hostilities among townspeople and within the Thioune clan. At once a tragicomic study of social atomization and a hopeful vision of Pan-African solidarity and independence, GUELWAAR is Ousmane Sembène’s master class in interweaving complex storylines and merging disparate stylistic tones."

With an Academy Award–nominated, autobiographical screenplay by Spanish political exile Jorge Semprún, LA GUERRE EST FINIE (“The War Is Over”) finds pioneering modernist Alain Resnais channeling his signature explorations of time and memory into a tense political thriller that gives voice to the revolutionary fervor and dashed dreams that marked a generation. Three decades after the Spanish Civil War, Communist operative Diego Mora (Yves Montand) finds himself juggling multiple secret identities as he continues his dangerous missions and reflects on a life of political struggle. Though he is increasingly disillusioned, his determination to help a possibly captured comrade and a chance encounter with an impetuous student terrorist (Geneviève Bujold) keep his commitment to the cause alive in a world of subterfuge and treachery."

Earning comparisons to the work of Harmony Korine and Roy Andersson, Ruben Östlund’s audacious feature debut is a defiantly lo-fi, virtually plotless portrait of iconoclasts and outsiders living on the margins of a fictional city known as Jöteborg (which closely resembles Gothenburg). Training his coolly detached, perpetually static camera on a cross section of hooligans, bikers, buskers, and oddballs, Östlund fashions a wild, weird, and at times surprisingly sensitive look at the ineffable strangeness of human nature."

Mathieu Kassovitz took the film world by storm with LA HAINE, a gritty, unsettling, and visually explosive look at the racial and cultural volatility in modern-day France, specifically the low-income banlieue districts on Paris’s outskirts. Aimlessly passing their days in the concrete environs of their dead-end suburbia, Vinz (Vincent Cassel), Hubert (Hubert Koundé), and Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui), a Jew, an African, and an Arab, give human faces to France’s immigrant populations, their bristling resentment at their marginalization slowly simmering until it reaches a climactic boiling point.

Collins attends college in search of opportunity while Bryant becomes a father to an energetic son in an open-ended, poetic chronicle that privileges the patiently observed interstices of their lives. The audience is invited to experience the mundane and the monumental, birth and death, the quotidian and the sublime.

Setting out to depict the dynamics of a queer relationship with empathy and complexity on the cusp of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong—when the country’s LGBTQ community suddenly faced an uncertain future—Wong crafts a feverish look at the life cycle of a love affair that is by turns devastating and deliriously romantic.

A HARD DAY’S NIGHT, in which the bandmates play cheeky comic versions of themselves, captured the astonishing moment when they officially became the singular, irreverent idols of their generation and changed music forever. Directed with raucous, anything-goes verve by Richard Lester and featuring a slew of iconic pop anthems, including the title track, “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “I Should Have Known Better,” and “If I Fell,” A HARD DAY’S NIGHT, which reconceived the movie musical and exerted an incalculable influence on the music video, is one of the most deliriously entertaining movies of all time."

In this warmhearted comic yarn from Aki Kaurismäki, fate throws the young African refugee Idrissa (Blondin Miguel) into the path of Marcel Marx (André Wilms), a kindly old bohemian who shines shoes for a living in the French harbor city Le Havre. With inborn optimism and the support of his tight-knit community, Marcel stands up to the officials doggedly pursuing the boy for deportation. A political fairy tale that exists somewhere between the reality of contemporary France and the classic French cinema of the past, LE HAVRE is a charming, deadpan delight and one of the Finnish director’s finest films."

Grave robbing, torture, possessed nuns, and a satanic Sabbath: Benjamin Christensen’s legendary silent film uses a series of dramatic vignettes to explore the scientific hypothesis that the witches of the Middle Ages and early modern era suffered from the same ills as psychiatric patients diagnosed with hysteria in the film&#39;s own time. Far from a dry dissertation on the topic, the film itself is a witches’ brew of the scary, the gross, and the darkly humorous. Christensen’s mix-and-match approach to genre anticipates gothic horror, documentary re-creation, and the essay film, making for an experience unlike anything else in the history of cinema."

A cinematic tone poem that flows from a sustained meditation on death and other forms of absence, the film seamlessly weaves together thoughts on Tibetan Buddhism, reincarnation, the modern surveillance state, and the artistic lives of dogs, with an elegy for the filmmaker&#39;s beloved rat terrier, Lolabelle, at its heart. Narrated by Anderson with her characteristic wry wit, and featuring a plaintive, free-form score by the filmmaker, the tender and provocative HEART OF A DOG continues Anderson&#39;s four-and-a-half-decade career of imbuing the everyday with a sense of dreamlike wonder."

Eye-popping motorcycle stunts, bloodthirsty undead, cannibal infants, and kinetically choreographed wirework are all part of the wall-to-wall delirium in this irresistible showcase for three of the coolest women warriors ever to hit the screen."

HERON 1954–2002 is a visual eulogy that taps into the phenomena of makeshift memorials and small gestures of mourning.

While Yankel, who now goes by Jake, has quickly acclimated to life in America—and even begun an affair with a dancer—Gitl initially struggles to assimilate. As she attempts to find her place within an unfamiliar culture, Gitl must find a way to become a victor instead of a victim."

A grand-scale adventure as only Akira Kurosawa could make one, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS stars the inimitable Toshiro Mifune as a general charged with guarding his defeated clan’s princess (a fierce Misa Uehara) as the two smuggle royal treasure across hostile territory. Accompanying them are a pair of bumbling, conniving peasants who may or may not be their friends. This rip-roaring ride is among the director’s most beloved films and was a primary influence on George Lucas’s STAR WARS.

The French television series “Les enthousiastes” asked art aficionados to offer their thoughts on, and interpretations of, paintings that they themselves selected. For Jean Eustache’s episode, Jean-Noël Picq (of A DIRTY STORY) chose the third panel of Hieronymus Bosch’s triptych “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” an apocalyptic nightmare-scape that anticipated the darkest reaches of surrealism by almost four hundred years. Looking beyond its obvious grotesqueries, Picq points out several notable qualities of Bosch’s masterwork, including its near absence of perspective, its conflation of ontological categories (human and animal, living and dead, time and space), and its objective depiction of sadomasochistic pleasure."

Focusing on counterculture couple Cyril (Phil Davis) and Shirley (Ruth Sheen)—a pair of generous, pot-smoking Marxists wrestling with the decision of whether or not to have a baby—and their materialistic, middle-class extended family, HIGH HOPES offers an at once affectionate and slyly critical portrait of generational, social, and class divides within Thatcher-era Britain."

In Ronald Neame’s film of Joyce Cary’s classic novel, Alec Guinness transforms himself into one of cinema’s most indelible comic figures: the lovably scruffy painter Gulley Jimson. As the ill-behaved Jimson searches for a perfect canvas, he determines to let nothing come between himself and the realization of his exalted vision. A perceptive examination of the struggle of artistic creation, THE HORSE’S MOUTH is also Neame’s comic masterpiece."

How to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi’s indescribable 1977 movie HOUSE (HAUSU)? As a psychedelic ghost tale? A stream-of-consciousness bedtime story? An episode of “Scooby-Doo” as directed by Mario Bava? Any of the above will do for this hallucinatory head trip about a schoolgirl who travels with six classmates to her ailing aunt’s creaky country home and comes face-to-face with evil spirits, a demonic house cat, a bloodthirsty piano, and other ghoulish visions, all realized by Obayashi via mattes, animation, and collage effects.

The only film directed by trailblazing feminist Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad finds unexpected grace where few would think to look: a leper colony whose inhabitants live, worship, learn, play, and celebrate in a self-contained community cut off from the rest of the world. Through ruminative voiceover narration drawn from the Old Testament, the Koran, and the filmmaker’s own poetry and unflinching images that refuse to look away from physical difference, Farrokhzad creates a profoundly empathetic portrait of those cast off by society—a face-to-face encounter with the humanity behind the disease.

Directed by Kim Ki-young • 1960 • South Korea

A torrent of sexual obsession, revenge, and betrayal is unleashed under one roof in this venomous melodrama from South Korean master Kim Ki-young. Immensely popular in its home country when it was released, THE HOUSEMAID is the thrilling, at times jaw-dropping story of the devastating effect an unstable housemaid has on the domestic cocoon of a bourgeois, morally dubious music teacher, his devoted wife, and their precocious young children. Grim and taut yet perched on the border of the absurd, Kim’s film is an engrossing tale of class warfare and familial disintegration that has been hugely influential on the new generation of South Korean filmmakers.

Grant gives a virtuosically crazed performance as an ambitious advertising exec whose latest assignment—devising a campaign for a pimple cream—has him on the edge of a nervous breakdown. When he sprouts an enormous boil on his shoulder—one that not only talks but has evil ambitions of its own—a twisted battle of wills ensues. With fantastically fleshy body-horror effects and flourishes of gonzo surrealism, this tour de force of verbal jousting and physical comedy is a caustic Jekyll-and-Hyde tale for the greed-is-good 1980s."

McQueen dramatizes prison existence and Sands’s final days in a way that is purely experiential, even abstract, a succession of images full of both beauty and horror.

Both a landmark of radical political cinema and one of the most visually ravishing films ever made, this legendary hymn to revolution shimmers across the screen like a fever dream of rebellion. The result of an extraordinarily ambitious collaboration between the Soviet and Cuban film industries, director Mikhail Kalatozov’s I AM CUBA unfolds in four explosive vignettes that capture Cuban life on the brink of transformation, as crushing economic exploitation and inequality give way to a working-class uprising. Backed by Carlos Fariñas’s stirring score, the dazzling camera work by Sergei Urusevsky—an inspiration for generations of filmmakers to follow—gives flight to the movie’s message of liberation."

This landmark document of Swedish society during the sexual revolution has been declared both obscene and revolutionary. It tells the story of Lena (Lena Nyman), a searching and rebellious young woman, and her personal quest to understand the social and political conditions in 1960s Sweden, as well as her bold exploration of her own sexual identity.

Over a series of intimate episodes, just about every one featuring a different man, a new hairstyle, and an outfit to match, the unsung Italian master Antonio Pietrangeli, working from a script he cowrote with Ettore Scola, composes a deft, seriocomic character study that never strays from its complicated central figure.

Two of Hong Kong cinema’s most iconic leading men, Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Andy Lau Tak-wah, face off in the breathtaking thriller that revitalized the city-state’s twenty-first-century film industry, launched a blockbuster franchise, and inspired Martin Scorsese’s THE DEPARTED. The setup is diabolical in its simplicity: two undercover moles—a police officer (Leung) assigned to infiltrate a ruthless triad by posing as a gangster, and a gangster (Lau) who becomes a police officer in order to serve as a spy for the underworld—find themselves locked in a deadly game of cat and mouse, each racing against time to unmask the other. As the shifting loyalties, murky moral compromises, and deadly betrayals mount, INFERNAL AFFAIRS raises haunting questions about what it means to live a double life, lost in a labyrinth of conflicting identities and allegiances."

The first of two sequels to follow in the wake of the massively successful INFERNAL AFFAIRS softens the original’s furious pulp punch in favor of something more sweeping, elegiac, and overtly political. Flashing back in time, INFERNAL AFFAIRS II traces the tangled histories that bind the trilogy’s two pairs of adversaries: the young, dueling moles (here played by Edison Chen Koon-hei and Shawn Yue Man-lok), and the ascendant crime boss (Eric Tsang Chi-wai) and police inspector (Anthony Wong Chau-sang) whose respective rises reveal a shocking hidden connection. Unfolding against the political and psychological upheaval of Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China, this elegant, character-driven crime drama powerfully connects its themes of split loyalties to the city-state’s own postcolonial identity crisis."

Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Andy Lau Tak-wah return for the cathartic conclusion of the INFERNAL AFFAIRS trilogy, which layers on even more deep-cover intrigue while steering the series into increasingly complex psychological territory. Dancing back and forth in time to before and after the events of the original film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS III follows triad gangster turned corrupt cop Lau Kin-ming (Lau) as he goes to dangerous lengths to avoid detection, matches wits with a devious rival in the force (Leon Lai), and finds himself haunted by the fate of his former undercover nemesis (Leung). A swirl of flashbacks, memories, and hallucinations culminates in a dreamlike merging of identities that drives home the trilogy’s vision of a world in which traditional distinctions between good and evil have all but collapsed."

Starring Louis Garrel, Roschdy Zem, Noémie Merlant

Part crime thriller, part family farce, Louis Garrel’s THE INNOCENT shows the dangerous lengths two men go to, and the outlandish lies they tell, for the women they love. Garrel stars as Abel, a museum educator and widower whose mother, Sylvie (Anouk Grinberg), marries Michel (Roschdy Zem), one of her drama pupils in the local penitentiary. Once on parole, Michel attempts to start a legitimate life for Sylvie’s sake but soon reverts to his old ways, with the suspicious Abel continually—and ineptly—spying on his stepfather until roped into one of the ex-con’s schemes. Complicating matters is Clémence (Noémie Merlant), the brazen coworker who convinces Abel to break out of his emotional and romantic shell by taking part in Michel’s planned heist. Directing from his own screenplay (as cowritten by Tanguy Viel and Naïla Guiguet), Garrel explores the comedic results of playacting’s intrusion into real life, as well as real life’s comedic tendency to transform us into what we never thought we could be, but perhaps always were.

“Sly and wonderful . . . Few caper comedies have this much heart, and few romantic dramas offer such an appealingly nutty plot.”

This gorgeous romantic confection, which catalogs a doomed love affair between a married violin virtuoso and a young pianist, is graced by a leading performance by Ingrid Bergman (her first), in a role created especially for her; a costarring turn by the legendary Swedish actor Gösta Ekman; and beautiful direction by Gustaf Molander. It was a defining part for Bergman, as it made her a star in Sweden and caught the eye of American producer David O. Selznick, who offered the young actor a Hollywood contract and the chance to remake INTERMEZZO in English with Leslie Howard."

Starring Sergio Rubini, Antonella Ponziani, Maurizio Mein

Something of a late-career companion to 8½, Federico Fellini’s penultimate film is a similarly self-reflexive (and self-deprecating) journey through both the director’s dream life and his cinematic world—which are, here as always in Fellini’s work, inextricably entwined. In Rome to make a documentary about the great filmmaker, a Japanese camera crew follows Fellini on a tour through his longtime home studio of Cinecittà as the maestro’s memories and fantasies unfurl in a dizzying, dazzling, time-bending love letter to the art and spectacle of moviemaking. The film’s sprawling vision even makes room for an appearance by Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg who, in an unforgettable bit of movie magic, relive their iconic Trevi Fountain scene from LA DOLCE VITA, lent new poignancy by the tacit acknowledgement of time’s passing."

Starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Maggie Cheung Man-yuk

Hong Kong, 1962: Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) move into neighboring apartments on the same day. Their encounters are formal and polite—until a discovery about their spouses creates an intimate bond between them. At once delicately mannered and visually extravagant, Wong Kar Wai’s IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is a masterful evocation of romantic longing and fleeting moments. With its aching musical soundtrack and exquisitely abstract cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Mark Lee Ping-bin, this film has been a major stylistic influence on the past decade of cinema, and is a milestone in Wong’s redoubtable career."

IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES (AI NO CORRIDA), by the always provocative Japanese director Nagisa Oshima, remains one of the most controversial films of all time. Based on a true incident, it graphically depicts the all-consuming, transcendent—but ultimately destructive—love of a man and a woman (Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda) living in an era of ever escalating imperialism and governmental control. Less a work of pornography than of politics, IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES is a brave, taboo-breaking milestone, still censored in its own country.

Meandering and consistently surprising, INTIMATE LIGHTING skirts the demands of plot in favor of subtler shades of mood.

One of the first major Hollywood films to deal seriously and sensitively with the subject of racial injustice, this landmark adaptation of the novel by William Faulkner features a towering performance by Juano Hernandez as Lucas Beauchamp, a Black man accused of murdering a white lumberman in a small Mississippi town. As the dead man’s brother whips the local whites into a lynch-mob frenzy, Beauchamp refuses to confess to the crime or give in to intimidation. Now it’s up to a few brave people to take a stand and—without regard to the race of either the victim or the accused—uncover the startling truth."

For the extraordinarily beautiful second film in his Fontainhas trilogy, Pedro Costa jettisoned his earlier films&#39; larger crews to burrow even deeper into the Lisbon ghetto and the lives of its desperate inhabitants. With the intimate feel of a documentary and the texture of a Vermeer painting, IN VANDA&#39;S ROOM takes an unflinching, fragmentary look at a handful of self-destructive, marginalized people, but is centered around the heroin-addicted Vanda Duarte. Costa presents the daily routines of Vanda and her neighbors with disarming matter-of-factness, and through his camera, individuals whom many would deem disposable become vivid and vital. This was Costa&#39;s first use of digital video, and the evocative images he created remain some of the medium&#39;s most astonishing."

In Southern India, many family disputes are settled by Jamaats—all-male bodies that apply Islamic Sharia law to cases without allowing women to be present, even to defend themselves. Recognizing this fundamental inequity, a group of women in 2004 established a women’s Jamaat, which soon became a network of 12,000 members spread over twelve districts. Despite enormous resistance, they have been able to settle more than 8,000 cases to date, ranging from divorce to domestic abuse to brutal murders and more. Award-winning filmmaker Deepa Dhanraj (SOMETHING LIKE A WAR) follows several such cases, shining a light on how the women’s Jamaat has acquired power through both communal education and the leaders’ persistent, tenacious, and compassionate investigation of the crimes."

Coward and Lean ended up codirecting the large-scale project—an impressive undertaking, especially considering that neither of them had directed for the big screen before (this would be Coward’s only such credit). Cutting between a major naval battle and flashbacks to the men’s lives before they left home, IN WHICH WE SERVE (an Oscar nominee for best picture) was a major breakthrough for both filmmakers and a sensitive and stirring piece of propaganda."

Modesty, whimsy, and clarity of design grace the work of Joe Brainard, an artist and writer whose evocations of memory and desire perhaps found their greatest expression in his memoir-poem “I Remember.” Here, filmmaker Matt Wolf returns to this classic work, creating an archival montage that combines Brainard’s own readings with an interview with his lifelong friend and collaborator, the poet Ron Padgett.

Olivier Assayas’s live-wire international breakthrough stars a magnetic Maggie Cheung as a version of herself: a Hong Kong action movie star who arrives in Paris to play the latex-clad lead in a remake of Louis Feuillade’s classic 1915 crime serial LES VAMPIRES. What she finds is a behind-the-scenes tangle of barely controlled chaos as egos clash, romantic attractions simmer, and an obsessive director (a cannily cast Jean-Pierre Léaud) drives himself to the brink to realize his vision. Blending blasts of silent cinema, martial arts flicks, and the music of Sonic Youth and Ali Farka Touré into a hallucinatory swirl of postmodern cool, Assayas composes a witty reflection on the nineties French film industry and the eternal tension between art and commercial entertainment."

Dividing the screen into a triptych of panels, Panh presents soul-shaking images of war’s devastation and mankind’s capacity for evil, from Auschwitz to Hiroshima to Vietnam and beyond.

In his new film, he lovingly evokes the aesthetics of Jean-Luc Godard, paying aptly cheeky respect to the late New Wave master, his own career, and cinema itself, rummaging through a century of movies to situate his work within a continuum of the medium. Rather than self-aggrandize, he uses this diaristic format for an iconoclastic and impudent inquiry into power, politics, and image-making that is at once wry and playful, oblique and deeply personal.

Directed by Federico Fellini • 1953 • Italy

Five young men linger in a postadolescent limbo, dreaming of adventure and escape from their small seacoast town. They while away their time spending the lira doled out by their indulgent families on drink, women, and nights at the local pool hall. Federico Fellini’s second solo directorial effort (originally released in the U.S. as THE YOUNG AND THE PASSIONATE) is a semiautobiographical masterpiece of sharply drawn character sketches: skirt chaser Fausto, forced to marry a girl he has impregnated; Alberto, the perpetual child; Leopoldo, a writer thirsting for fame; and Moraldo, the only member of the group troubled by a moral conscience. An international success and recipient of an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay, I VITELLONI compassionately details a year in the life of a group of small-town layabouts struggling to find meaning in their lives."

For two brothers, the daily struggles of bullies and mean teachers is nothing next to the mortification they feel when they realize their good-natured father&#39;s low-rung social status. Reworked decades later as Ozu&#39;s Technicolor comedy Good Morning, it&#39;s a poignant evocation of the tumult of childhood, as well as a showcase for Ozu&#39;s expertly timed comedy editing."

Terry Gilliam’s first outing as a solo director—inspired by Lewis Carroll’s poem “Jabberwocky” and made following Gilliam’s success as a member of the iconic comedy troupe Monty Python—showcases his delight in comic nonsense, with a cast chock-full of beloved British character actors.

Agnès Varda’s tender evocation of the childhood of her husband, Jacques Demy—a dream project that she realized for him when he became too ill to direct it himself—is a wonder-filled portrait of the artist as a young man and an enchanting ode to the magic of cinema. Shot in Demy’s hometown of Nantes (including the house he grew up in), this imaginative blend of narrative and documentary traces his coming of age as he finds escape from the tumult of World War II in puppet shows, fairy tales, opera, and, above all, movies—the formative aesthetic experiences that would fuel his vivid Technicolor imagination and find unforgettable expression in his exuberant New Wave masterworks. Interspersing intimate footage of the older Demy reflecting on his life’s journey, JACQUOT DE NANTES is a poignant love letter from one visionary artist to another."

Made over the course of a year and motivated by Birkin’s fortieth birthday—a milestone she admits to some anxiety over—JANE B. PAR AGNÈS V. contrasts the private, reflective Birkin with Birkin the icon, as Varda casts her variously as a classical muse, a femme fatale, a Spanish dancer, Joan of Arc, and even a deadpan Laurel opposite a clownish Hardy in a fanciful slapstick spoof. Made in the spirit of pure, uninhibited play, this free-flowing dual portrait unfolds as a shared reverie between two women as they collapse the boundaries between artist and subject."

Recruiting a cast of nonactors and filming in sublime 16 mm CinemaScope, Reygadas explores the harsh beauty of the Mexican country­side with earthy tactility, conjuring a psychic landscape where religion mingles with sex, life coexists with death, and the animal and spiritual sides of human experience become indistinguishable.

His neighbors, however, the scheming Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) and his proud uncle César Soubeyran (Yves Montand), have plotted to divert the flow of water away from Jean’s land. Brought to extraordinary life by acting legends Depardieu, Auteuil, and Montand, JEAN DE FLORETTE draws viewers into a fully realized vision of 1920s rural France in which the culture clash between modern ideas and the rustic older codes of the country takes a heartbreaking turn."

After a young theology student flees a hit-and-run accident, he is plagued by both his own guilt-ridden conscience and a mysterious, diabolical doppelgänger. But all possible escape routes lead straight to hell, literally. In the gloriously gory final third of the film, Nakagawa offers up his vision of the underworld in a tour de force of torture and degradation. A striking departure from traditional Japanese ghost stories, JIGOKU, with its truly eye-popping (and -gouging) imagery, created aftershocks that are still reverberating in contemporary world horror cinema."

In this moving first-person documentary, a young filmmaker delves into her mother and grandmother’s complicated pasts and her own fractured Iranian identity. Having grown up in rural Vermont, far removed from the homeland of her mother, Mitra, and grandmother, Behjat, Sierra Urich knew of Iran only through family stories, food, and holidays. Seeking to make sense of her heritage, she turns to Mitra and Behjat to construct a probing and sometimes disarmingly funny history of three generations of women and their complex relationship to an Iran of the past. Interrogating family history and memory, including her grandmother’s experiences as a preteen bride and her mother’s rebellious teenage years during the Iranian Revolution, Urich crafts a rich, personal family portrait that poignantly reflects the diasporic experience."

More than just the anatomy of a relationship, Rossellini’s masterpiece is a heartrending work of emotion and spirituality.

The first Pakistani film to debut at Cannes—where it was awarded both the Jury Prize in the Un Certain Regard category and the Queer Palm—this tender, emotionally captivating debut from writer-director Saim Sadiq explores the many sides of love and desire in a patriarchal society. Gentle and timid, Haider (Ali Junejo) lives with his wife and family in Lahore. Following a long spell of unemployment, Haider finally lands a job at a Bollywood-style burlesque as a backup dancer. The unusual position shakes up the tradition-bound dynamics of his household and enables Haider to break out of his shell. As he acclimates to the new job, Haider becomes infatuated with the strong-willed trans woman (Alina Khan) who runs the show—a partnership that opens his eyes and ultimately his worldview, in ways both unexpected and intimate.


“Brimming with life and novelistic detail . . . a delicate, intelligent and emotionally rich film. What a debut from Sadiq.”

Starring Raizo Ichikawa, Rokko Toura, Asao Uchida

Raizo Ichikawa plays the reluctant warrior to perfection in KENKI, the final installment of Kenji Misumi&#39;s Sword Trilogy and, as adapted from another Renzaburo Shibata novel, a brazenly unique hybrid of the samurai, supernatural, and romance genres. Rumored to be the product of a union between a woman and a dog, humble gardener Hanpei (Ichikawa) serves as a low-ranking vassal in the castle of a clan lord (Rokko Toura) slowly succumbing to insanity. While at first ridiculed for his strange origins and reserved nature, Hanpei eventually earns respect for his preternatural running abilities and the vicious sword-drawing technique he learns from a mysterious ronin (Asao Uchida). When the clan is thrown into intensifying disarray and dissension, Hanpei must sacrifice his gentle ways—and his love for the beautiful Saki (Michiko Sugata)—in order to fend for himself. Once more exploring the symbolic possibilities of the chanbara, Misumi plumbs the spiritual duality of the peaceful man forced into violence."

The final film pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall is a torrid noir chamber piece adapted from Maxwell Anderson’s play of the same name and directed with sweltering, claustrophobic tension by John Huston. A hurricane swells outside, but it’s nothing compared to the storm brewing within the walls of the Hotel Largo in the Florida Keys. It’s there that sadistic mobster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) holds hotel owner Nora Temple (Bacall) and her invalid father-in-law (Lionel Barrymore) hostage at gunpoint—with world weary ex-GI Frank McCloud (Bogart) as perhaps the one man capable of standing up to him. Claire Trevor received a best supporting actress Oscar for her searing portrayal of Rocco’s gold-hearted, boozy moll."

Charlie Chaplin was already an international star when he decided to break out of the short-film format and make his first full-length feature. THE KID doesn&#39;t merely show Chaplin at a turning point, when he proved that he was a serious film director, it remains an expressive masterwork of silent cinema. In it, he stars as his lovable Tramp character, this time raising an orphan (a remarkable young Jackie Coogan) he has rescued from the streets.

Silent-comedy legend Harold Lloyd goes west in this irresistible blend of action, romance, and slapstick invention. The bespec­tacled everyman is at his inimitable best as Harold Hickory, the gentle son of a prominent lawman who lives in the shadow of his rough-and-tumble brothers. When a traveling medicine show rolls into town, it brings with it excitement, the possibility of love, and a chance for Harold to prove his mettle. Deftly balancing Lloyd’s brilliant sight gags and thrilling set pieces—including an epic, knock-down, drag-out fight aboard an abandoned ship—with one of the actor-filmmaker’s most fully realized, root-for-the-underdog narratives, THE KID BROTHER is a hilarious and heartwarming high-water mark of early screen comedy."

Set against a rich evocation of postwar London’s East End Jewish quarter, Carol Reed’s touchingly bittersweet Technicolor fable concerns a young boy (Jonathan Ashmore) who comes into possession of a curiously-horned goat he believes to be a unicorn with the power to grant wishes. And then, miraculously, the dreams of those around him really do seem to come true . . .

One, previously a farmer, longs to become a noble samurai. The other, a former samurai haunted by his past, prefers living anonymously with gangsters. But when both men discover the wrongdoings of the nefarious clan leader, they side with a band of rebels who are under siege at a remote mountain cabin. Based on the same source novel as Akira Kurosawa’s SANJURO, KILL! playfully tweaks samurai film convention, borrowing elements from established chanbara classics and seasoning them with a little Italian western."

An epic chanbara (sword-fighting film) in compact form, KIRU (a.k.a. DESTINY’S SON) depicts the life of Shingo Takakura (Raizo Ichikawa), a master samurai with a mysterious past and an unvanquishable combat technique. When his surrogate father (Shinjiro Asano) is killed by a jealous rival, Shingo learns of his true origin as the abandoned offspring of a female assassin (Shiho Fujimura) and her lover-turned-executioner (Shigeru Amachi). Shingo’s journey through the nineteenth-century Japanese countryside as a twice-orphaned wanderer ultimately lands him in the employ of an honorable shogunate (Eijiro Yanagi) with powerful enemies during a period of political upheaval. As adapted from a Renzaburo Shibata novel by legendary screenwriter Kaneto Shindo, KIRU meditates on the profundity and fragility of father-son relationships, a theme of personal significance to director Kenji Misumi, who suffered from abandonment and rejection from his own father. Misumi’s subtle yet poignant touches result in a minor chanbara masterpiece in which a young man must find his calling, with and without the guidance of a sensei."

Starring Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey

Perhaps the finest neonoir since CHINATOWN, Curtis Hanson’s masterful adaptation of the novel by James Ellroy brings the sleazy underbelly of 1950s Los Angeles to the screen with sizzle and punch. Following a bloody mass murder early in the New Year, three detectives in the corrupt LA police force find themselves drawn into a web of scandal and violence. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) makes money on the side by setting up celebrity arrests so that Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) can scoop them in his gossip magazine. Officer Bud White (Russell Crowe) will break any rule to bring criminals to justice. And Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) will do anything to get ahead as long as it’s by the book. The way Hanson orchestrates each piece of this taut, multistrand storyline is a thing of hard-boiled beauty."

The famously byzantine plot—a tangle of head-spinning twists and double crosses—takes a back seat to the shadow-etched visuals, bravura set pieces (including iconic hall-of-mirrors shoot-out), and dreamlike mood."

Adapted from a classic novel by Abd al-Rahman Sharqawi, this howl of rage against social injustice is one of director Youssef Chahine’s most influential works, crowned by a career-best performance from its star Mahmoud el-Meliguy. Set in the early 1930s, THE LAND urgently portrays the struggle of rural peasants whose livelihood is threatened by a greedy landlord’s scheme to limit their water supply, showing both the power and limitations of resistance in the face of class exploitation. Composed in vivid, sensuous images and shot through with revolutionary fervor, this landmark of Arab cinema—the inaugural entry in Chahine’s so-dubbed Trilogy of Defeat—is a work of both immense humanism and searing political conviction, informed by the burning sensation of collective failure in the wake of the Six-Day War."

Starring Haruko Sugimura, Ken Uehara, Sadako Sawamura

Suffused with the sense of autumnal melancholy and nostalgia that its title suggests, LATE CHRYSANTHEMUMS is one of director Mikio Naruse’s most perfectly realized works. In a rare starring role, the great Haruko Sugimura (FLOATING WEEDS, TOKYO STORY) portrays Kin, a former geisha who has parlayed her earnings from her erstwhile profession into work as a moneylender; but most of her clients are ex-colleagues of hers, and their lives are not what they once were, nor do any of them have much real chance for happiness. As in many of Naruse’s films, the focus is on the heartbreaking limitations of women’s lives as they see their opportunities constricted by the inexorable passage of time."

Eminent Ozu players Chishu Ryu and Setsuko Hara command this poignant tale of love and loss in postwar Japan, which remains as potent today as ever, and a strong justification for its maker’s inclusion in the pantheon of cinema’s greatest directors."

Set along the Turkish-Syrian frontier, this terse, elemental tale of smugglers contending with a changing social landscape brought together two giants of Turkish cinema. Director Lütfi Ö. Akad had already made some of his country’s most notable films when he was approached by Yılmaz Güney—a rising action star who would become Turkey’s most important and controversial filmmaker—to collaborate on this neo-western about a quiet man who finds himself pitted against his fellow outlaws. Combining documentary authenticity with a tough, lean poetry, LAW OF THE BORDER transformed the nation’s cinema forever—even though it was virtually impossible to see for many years.

In a richly layered performance, Binoche plays Isabelle, a successful painter in Paris whose apparent independence belies what she desires most: real romantic fulfillment. Isabelle reveals deep wells of yearning, vulnerability, and resilience as she tumbles into relationships with all the wrong men.

Considered by many to be the finest British film ever made, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP, by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, is a stirring masterpiece like no other. Roger Livesey dynamically embodies outmoded English militarism as the indelible General Clive Candy, who barely survives four decades of tumultuous British history, 1902 to 1942, only to see the world change irrevocably before his eyes. Anton Walbrook and Deborah Kerr provide unforgettable support, he as a German enemy turned lifelong friend of Candy’s and she as young women of three consecutive generations, a socially committed governess, a sweet-souled war nurse, and a modern-thinking army driver, who inspire him. COLONEL BLIMP is both moving and slyly satirical, an incomparable film about war, love, aging, and obsolescence, shot in gorgeous Technicolor."

In LIFE DURING WARTIME, independent filmmaker Todd Solondz explores contemporary American existence and the nature of forgiveness with his customary dry humor and queasy precision. The film functions as a distorted mirror image of Solondz’s acclaimed 1998 dark comedy HAPPINESS, its emotionally stunted characters now groping for the possibility of change in a post-9/11 world. HAPPINESS’s grim New Jersey setting is transposed mainly to sunny Florida, but the biggest twist is that new actors fill the roles from the earlier film—including Shirley Henderson, Allison Janney, and Ally Sheedy as alarmingly dissimilar sisters, and Ciarán Hinds hauntingly embodying a reformed pedophile. Shot in expressionistic tones by cinematographer extraordinaire Ed Lachman, Solondz’s film finds the humor in the tragic and the tragic in the everyday."

A visually intoxicating queer rhapsody of desire and repression, revenge and redemption unfolds as a deliriously stylized play-within-a-film in this sumptuous cinematic pageant adapted from the stage work by Michel Marc Bouchard. In a Quebec prison in 1952, an aging priest (Marcel Sabourin) sits down to hear the confession of a convict (Aubert Pallascio)—only to have the tables turned on him as the prisoner, aided by his fellow inmates, stages a time- and space-collapsing play that takes them both back to 1912, when they were young men engaged in a tragic love triangle with another boy (Danny Gilmore). Described by director John Greyson as a “strange, Genet-inflected-via-Fellini fable,” this entrancingly beautiful, gender-bending fantasia stands as one of the rapturous peaks of the New Queer Cinema."

Directed by Charles Chaplin • 1952 • United States
Starring Charles Chaplin, Claire Bloom, Nigel Bruce

Charlie Chaplin’s masterful drama about the twilight of a former vaudeville star is among the writer-director’s most touching films. Chaplin plays Calvero, a once beloved musical-comedy performer, now a washed-up alcoholic who lives in a small London flat. A glimmer of hope arrives when he meets a beautiful but melancholy ballerina (Claire Bloom) who lives downstairs. An elegant mix of the comic and the tragic, this poignant movie also features Buster Keaton in an extended cameo, marking the only time the two silent comedy icons appeared in a film together. Made at a time when Chaplin was under attack by the American press and far right, LIMELIGHT was scarcely distributed in the United States upon its initial release, but it is now considered one of his essential and most personal works."

Directed by Mário Peixoto • 1931 • Brazil
Starring Olga Breno, Taciana Rei, Carmen Santos

An astonishing creation, LIMITE is the only feature by the Brazilian director and author Mário Peixoto, made when he was just twenty-two years old. Inspired by a haunting André Kertész photograph on the cover of a French magazine, this avant-garde silent master­piece centers on a man and two women lost at sea, their pasts unfolding through flashbacks propelled by the music of Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, and others. An early work of independent Latin American filmmaking, LIMITE was famously difficult to see for most of the twentieth century. It is a pioneering achievement that continues to captivate with its timeless visual poetry.

A notorious, now aging former military dictator stands trial for atrocities committed against Guatemala’s Maya communities. While battling legal repercussions and the people’s demands for justice, he and his family are plagued by a series of increasingly strange and disturbing occurrences, seemingly brought on by an enigmatic new housekeeper (María Mercedes Coroy).

Suffused with both enchantment and melancholy, this autobiographical film takes on the perspective of a quiet, lonely boy growing up in Liverpool in the 1950s. But rather than employ a straightforward narrative, Davies jumps in and out of time, swoops into fantasies and fears, summons memories and dreams. A singular filmic tapestry, THE LONG DAY CLOSES is an evocative, movie- and music-besotted portrait of the artist as a young man."

Starring Elliott Gould, Nina van Pallandt, Sterling Hayden

Robert Altman updates Raymond Chandler for the liberated, hedonistic 1970s in this brilliantly idiosyncratic adaptation of one of the writer’s most renowned novels. Elliott Gould brings a sardonic wit to his portrayal of private eye Philip Marlowe, who helps out his old friend Terry Lennox (Jim Bouton) late one night by driving him across the border from Los Angeles to Tijuana—only to discover once he’s back that Lennox’s wife has been murdered. As Marlowe is drawn deeper into a labyrinthine investigation involving the search for a missing novelist (Sterling Hayden), Altman exposes the darkness lurking beneath California’s sun-splashed surface."

Starring Bob Hoskins, Helen Mirren, Dave King

A combustible performance from Bob Hoskins is the fuse that lights this underworld saga, a landmark of British crime cinema. Hoskins plays Harold Shand, an ambitious London mobster who, just as he attempts to close a major real-estate deal with the American Mafia, finds his crime empire rocked by a string of attacks, sending him on a ruthless quest to find out who’s responsible. Abetted by an ice-cool performance from Helen Mirren as Shand’s in-command moll, THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY is not only a gripping gangster thriller but also a vivid portrait of late-1970s Britain—a powder keg of cultural and political tensions on the verge of explosion."

Shot in stunning chiaroscuro by master cinematographer Gregg Toland, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME is John Ford’s and screenwriter Dudley Nichols’s lyrical adaptation of four one-act plays by Eugene O’Neill, distilled into one movingly expressive human drama. En route from the West Indies to Baltimore aboard the British tramp steamer the SS Glencairn, a motley crew of men—including Irishman Driscoll (Thomas Mitchell), young Swede Olsen (John Wayne), and Brit Smitty (Ian Hunter)—confront both personal demons and the specter of World War II. When the ship takes on a cargo of dynamite and suspicion grows that one of the crew members may be a German spy, tension and fear threaten the men’s camaraderie."

During their two year marriage, Alison (Mary Ure) has carried the full brunt of Jimmy’s anger and frustration, as well as his intense love. When Alison’s friend Helena Charles (Claire Bloom), an actress, moves in with the couple, she becomes a witness to their turbulent relationship and a catalyst for further unrest within the household."

Sara Rogers (Seret Scott), a black professor of philosophy, is embarking on an intellectual quest to understand “ecstasy” just as her painter husband, Victor (Bill Gunn), sets off on a more earthy exploration of joy. Over the course of a summer idyll in upstate New York, the two each experience profound emotional and romantic awakenings. Applying a deft comic touch to a deeply personal exploration of love, race, and gender, Collins crafts a charming, complex tale of personal discovery that, after decades of neglect, has reemerged as a still-fresh landmark of independent cinema."

When a young woman spends the night with an alleged terrorist, her quiet, ordered life falls into ruins. THE LOST HONOR OF KATHARINA BLUM portrays an anxious era in West Germany amid a crumbling postwar political consensus. Katharina, though apparently innocent, suddenly becomes a suspect, falling prey to a vicious smear campaign by the police and a ruthless tabloid journalist that tests the limits of her dignity and her sanity. Crafting one of the most accessible and direct works of 1970s political filmmaking, Volker Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta deliver a powerful adaptation of Heinrich Böll’s novel, a stinging commentary on state power, individual freedom, and media manipulation that is as relevant today as when it was released."

As beguiling a raconteur as he is a performer, Louie makes for a wildly entertaining movie subject, and Zwigoff honors him with an unsentimental but endlessly affectionate tribute.

Golden-age Hollywood’s humanist master Leo McCarey brings his graceful touch and relaxed naturalism to this sublime romance, one of cinema’s most intoxicating tear-wringers. Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer are chic strangers who meet and fall in love aboard an ocean liner bound for New York. Though they are both involved with other people, they make a pact to reconnect six months later at the top of the Empire State Building—until the hand of fate throws their star-crossed affair tragically off course. Swooning passion and gentle comedy coexist in perfect harmony in the exquisitely tender LOVE AFFAIR (nominated for six Oscars), a story so timeless that it has been remade by multiple filmmakers over the years—including McCarey himself, who updated it as the no less beloved AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER."

Dafoe is the pomade-slicked, leather-clad Vance, whose outlaw motorcycle gang roars into a small Southern town en route to the Daytona races, igniting simmering tensions with the locals and setting the stage for a violent standoff.

Stanley Kwan’s sordid tale of lust and murder begins as three friends—beautiful model Billie (Irene Wan), up-and-coming starlet Ping (Elaine Jin), and singer Ling (Tsai Chin)—become involved with Tony (a young Tony Leung Chiu-wai in one of his first film roles), the playboy son of a wealthy rice merchant. Tony has a penchant for nightclubs and drinking, and together the four enjoy a lifestyle of hedonistic pleasure. When Ling is found brutally murdered, it’s up to methodical Detective Lan (Chow Yun-fat, on the verge of action stardom) to investigate, putting the remaining survivors under scrutiny as he attempts to unravel their complicated relationships."

Starring Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom, Gio Petré

The title of Mai Zetterling’s boldly iconoclastic debut feature—adapted from a cycle of seven novels by the provocative feminist writer Agnes von Krusenstjerna—drips with irony. In 1915, three pregnant women from varying social backgrounds (Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom, and Gio Petré) enter a maternity ward. Cue a swirl of perspective-shifting flashbacks that, with searing psychological insight, illuminate the divergent yet interconnected experiences that brought them there—and that came to a head during one lavish, debauched Midsommar celebration. Wildly subversive in its treatment of sexuality, gender, class, religion, marriage, and motherhood, LOVING COUPLES is as electrifying a first feature as any in cinema history, announcing the arrival of an uncompromising artist in pursuit of raw emotional truth."

The life and work of celebrated American writer Patricia Highsmith are revealed through her diaries and notebooks and the intimate reflections of her lovers, friends, and family in this fascinating documentary. While many of her most famous novels—including “Strangers on a Train,” “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” and the partly autobiographical lesbian love story “The Price of Salt”—were adapted into acclaimed films, Highsmith herself was forced to lead a double life and had to hide her vibrant same-sex affairs from her family and the public. Only in her unpublished writings did she reflect on her rich private life. Excerpts from these notes voiced by Gwendoline Christie are beautifully interwoven with archival materials to create a vivid, touching portrait of a complex artist."

Jean Renoir’s fascinating adaptation of Maxim Gorky’s classic proletariat play softens the bleak social realism of the source material thanks to the director’s gently humanist, distinctly Gallic touch. Comedy and drama, love and death intertwine in a dingy flophouse where the petty thief Pépel (Jean Gabin) finds himself caught a love triangle with two sisters while striking up an improbable friendship with a nobleman (a wonderfully amusing Louis Jouvet) who soon falls on hard times himself."

One of Akira Kurosawa’s darkest, most uncompromising films, this by turns bleak and blackly comic adaptation of Maxim Gorky’s social-realist play transplants the story to nineteenth-century Japan, where the residents of a squalid boardinghouse navigate love, tragedy, and the conflict between their illusions and harsh reality. Making maximal use of the theatrical, claustrophobic setting and a powerhouse ensemble cast headed by Toshiro Mifune and Isuzu Yamada, Kurosawa channels Japan’s postwar disillusionment into a howl of existential angst."

A breathtaking vision of Cuban revolutionary history wrought with white-hot intensity by Humberto Solás, this operatic epic tells the story of a changing country through the eyes of three women, each named Lucía. In 1895, she is a tragic noblewoman who inadvertently betrays her country for love during the war of independence. In 1932, she is the daughter of a bourgeois family drawn into the workers’ uprising against the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado. And in the postrevolutionary 1960s, she is a newlywed farm girl fighting against patriarchal oppression. A formally dazzling landmark of postcolonial cinema, LUCÍA is both a senses-stunning visual experience and a fiercely feminist portrait of a society journeying toward liberation."

Investigating revolutionary Patrice Lumumba’s brief tenure as the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as the machinations behind his shocking assassination, legendary Haitian filmmaker Raoul Peck (I AM NOT YOUR NEGRO) discovers critical flashpoints where a nation’s officially curated narratives intersect with repressed truths. At eight years old, Peck was brought by his family to the newly independent DRC, where his father worked for the United Nations as an agricultural professor and his mother served as secretary to the mayor of Kinshasa. Sifting through his childhood recollections and interviewing Belgian journalists and politicians who witnessed the country’s descent into internecine violence, Peck fashions a prismatic meditation on the elusiveness of political objectivity and the ethics of personal remembrance in chronicling the traumas of history."

This genre-defying horror-musical mash-up—the bold debut of Polish director Agnieszka Smoczyńska—follows a pair of carnivorous mermaid sisters drawn ashore to explore life on land in an alternate 1980s Poland. Their tantalizing siren songs and otherworldly auras make them overnight sensations as nightclub singers in the half-glam, half-decrepit world of Smoczyńska’s imagining. The director gives fierce teeth to her viscerally sensual, darkly feminist twist on Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid,” in which the girls’ bond is tested and their survival threatened after one sister falls for a human. A coming-of-age fairy tale with a catchy synth-fueled soundtrack, outrageous song-and-dance numbers, and lavishly grimy sets, THE LURE explores its themes of emerging female sexuality, exploitation, and the compromises of adulthood with savage energy and originality."

The themes, images, and cultural vernacular of Victor Fleming’s THE WIZARD OF OZ continue to haunt David Lynch’s filmography—from his early short THE ALPHABET to his recent television series TWIN PEAKS: THE RETURN. Arguably, no filmmaker has so consistently drawn inspiration—consciously or unconsciously—from a single work. Is Lynch trapped in the Land of Oz? If so, what can we learn about his body of work by taking a closer look at how it intersects and communicates with that legendary fantasy? In turn, what do Lynch’s films have to say about the enduring resonance of one of America’s most beloved classics? Through six distinct perspectives, Alexandre O. Philippe’s LYNCH/OZ helps us reexperience and reinterpret THE WIZARD OF OZ by way of David Lynch, delivering new appreciations of both.

A kaleidoscopic tour through swinging-sixties London featuring appearances by everyone from Monty Python members John Cleese and Graham Chapman to Raquel Welch and Christopher Lee (plus an uncredited Yul Brynner in drag), THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN stands as one of the most unrelentingly bonkers, out-there comedies of the era."

Starring Josef Köstlinger, Irma Urrila, Håkan Hagegård

This scintillating screen version of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s beloved opera showcases Ingmar Bergman’s deep knowledge of music and gift for expressing it cinematically. Casting some of Europe’s finest soloists—Josef Köstlinger, Ulrik Cold, Håkan Hagegård, and Birgit Nordin among them—the director lovingly recreated the baroque theater of Sweden’s Drottningholm Palace to stage the story of the prince Tamino and his zestful sidekick Papageno, who are sent on a mission to save a beautiful princess from the clutches of evil. A celebration of love and forgiveness that exhibits a profound appreciation for the artifice and spectacle of the theater, THE MAGIC FLUTE is among the most exquisite opera films ever made."

With THE MAGICIAN, an engaging, brilliantly conceived tale of chicanery that doubles as a symbolic portrait of the artist as a deceiver, Ingmar Bergman proved himself to be one of cinema’s premier illusionists. Max von Sydow stars as Dr. Vogler, a nineteenth-century traveling mesmerist and peddler of potions whose magic is put to the test in Stockholm by the cruel, eminently rational royal medical adviser Dr. Vergérus (Gunnar Björnstrand). The result is a diabolically clever battle of wits that’s both frightening and funny, shot by Gunnar Fischer in rich, gorgeously gothic black and white."

The result is a captivating study of a vibrant personality, Juliane Sellam, a seventy-seven-year-old astrologer who has lived in the same apartment (a Haussmannian perch overflowing with geraniums and personality) in Montmartre for fifty years. As Juliane welcomes Sofia into her light-filled world, a unique connection forms between these two women across generations."

The two oldest have been married for some time, but according to tradition, the rebellious youngest sister cannot wed until the third, conservative and terribly shy, finds a husband.

With its low budget and lush black-and-white imagery, Gus Van Sant’s debut feature MALA NOCHE heralded an idiosyncratic, provocative new voice in American independent film. Set in Van Sant’s hometown of Portland, Oregon, the film evokes a world of transient workers, dead-end day-shifters, and bars and seedy apartments bathed in a profound nighttime, as it follows a romantic deadbeat with a wayward crush on a handsome Mexican immigrant. MALA NOCHE was an important prelude to the New Queer Cinema of the nineties and is a fascinating capsule from a time and place that continues to haunt its director’s work."

With MAMBAR PIERRETTE, her feature narrative debut, Mbakam turns her eye to the eponymous Pierrette (Pierrette Aboheu Njeuthat), a gifted seamstress who works to support her young children and mother in the city of Douala, Cameroon. More than a tailor, she is the confidant of her customers and community. But when it starts pouring and the rain threatens to flood her workshop—one of many misfortunes—Pierrette will have to struggle to stay afloat. Marked by moments of everyday beauty and quiet grace, Mbakam’s naturalistic approach yields a quietly affecting portrait of resilience in the face of adversity and socioeconomic hardship."

This second feature by Ousmane Sembène was the first movie ever made in the Wolof language—a major step toward the realization of the trailblazing Senegalese filmmaker’s dream of creating a cinema by, about, and for Africans. After jobless Ibrahima Dieng receives a money order for 25,000 francs from a nephew who works in Paris, news of his windfall quickly spreads among his neighbors, who flock to him for loans even as he finds his attempts to cash the order stymied in a maze of bureaucracy, and new troubles rain down on his head. One of Sembène’s most coruscatingly funny and indignant films, MANDABI—an adaptation of a novella by the director himself—is a bitterly ironic depiction of a society scarred by colonialism and plagued by corruption, greed, and poverty."

With the simplest of concepts and sparest of techniques, Robert Bresson made one of the most suspenseful jailbreak films of all time in A MAN ESCAPED. Based on the account of an imprisoned French Resistance leader, this unbelievably taut and methodical marvel follows the fictional Fontaine’s single-minded pursuit of freedom, detailing the planning and execution of his escape with gripping precision.

Michael Mann’s hypnotic, hyperstylized adaptation of Thomas Harris’s novel “Red Dragon” was the first film to introduce audiences to the infamous Hannibal Lecter. Will Graham (William Petersen) is a former FBI criminal profiler who is coaxed out of retirement to assist in the investigation of a serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). In order to understand the killer’s motivations, Graham must turn to the man who originally ended his career and who haunts his past: the brilliant, charismatic, and psychopathic cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox)."

Directed by Lino Brocka • 1975 • Philippines
Starring Hilda Koronel, Rafael Roco Jr., Lou Salvador Jr.

Lino Brocka achieved international acclaim with this candid portrait of 1970s Manila, a breakout example of the more serious-minded filmmaking the director had turned to after building a career on mainstream movies he described as “soaps.” A young fisherman from a provincial village arrives in the capital on a quest to track down his girlfriend, who was lured there with the promise of work and hasn’t been heard from since. In the meantime, he takes a low-wage job at a construction site and witnesses life on the streets, where death strikes without warning, corruption and exploitation are commonplace, and protests hint at escalating civil unrest. Mixing visceral, documentary-like realism with the narrative focus of Hollywood noir and melodrama, MANILA IN THE CLAWS OF LIGHT is a howl of anguish from one of the most celebrated figures in Philippine cinema.

Restored in 2013 by the Film Development Council of the Philippines and the Cineteca di Bologna/L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, in association with The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project, LVN, Cinema Artists Philippines, and Mike De Leon. Restoration funded by Doha Film Institute."

This tale of treachery put both the Gainsborough melodrama and actor James Mason on the map. The star-to-be plays Lord Rohan, a cruel nobleman who marries the naive and sweet-natured Clarissa (Phyllis Calvert) for the sole purpose of producing an heir; meanwhile, Clarissa&#39;s conniving best friend, Hesther (Margaret Lockwood), plots against her for her own nefarious ends. THE MAN IN GREY, directed by Leslie Arliss, was such a box-office success that Gainsborough used it as a template, launching a cycle of increasingly rococo films.

Man Is Not a Bird is an antic, free-form portrait of the love lives of two less-than-heroic men who labor in a copper factory. For this first feature, following years of making documentaries and experimental shorts, Dusan Makavejev and his crew set up shop in Bor, a mining town in the mountains near Yugoslavia&#39;s border with Bulgaria, interviewing the workers in the region and even shooting footage inside the local ore factories. Yet the result is hardly a staid tribute to the working class.

Back in his home country of Pakistan, Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi, elements of whose own life story were woven into the script) was a famous rock star. Now a widower separated from his son and adrift in New York, he works long hours selling coffee and bagels from a Midtown Manhattan food cart, engaged in a Sisyphean search for human connection and a sense of purpose that seems perpetually just out of reach. A rare immigrant’s-eye view of a post-9/11 city suffused with subtle paranoia and xenophobia, MAN PUSH CART gives at once empathetic and clear-eyed expression to the everyday drama of human endurance."

Vláčil’s approach was to re-create the textures and mentalities of a long-ago way of life, rather than to make a conventional historical drama, and the result is dazzling.

Twenty years after their brilliant cinema-theater experiment VANYA ON 42ND STREET, Wallace Shawn and André Gregory reunited to produce another idiosyncratic film version of a classic play, this time Henrik Ibsen’s “Bygmester Solness” (“Master Builder Solness”). Brought pristinely to the screen by Jonathan Demme, this compellingly abstract reimagining features Shawn (who also wrote the adaptation) as a visionary but tyrannical middle-aged architect haunted by figures from his past, most acutely an attractive, vivacious young woman (the breathtaking newcomer Lisa Joyce) who has appeared on his doorstep. Also featuring standout supporting performances by Julie Hagerty, Larry Pine, and Gregory, A MASTER BUILDER, like VANYA, is the result of many years of rehearsals, a living, breathing, constantly shifting work that unites theater, film, and dream."

Before he turned to the story of Joan of Arc, the Danish cinema genius Carl Theodor Dreyer fashioned this ahead-of-its-time examination of domestic life. A deft comedy of gentle revenge, it is the story of a housewife who, with the help of a wily nanny, turns the tables on her tyrannical husband. In it, Dreyer combines lightness and humor with his customary meticulous craft and sense of integrity. MASTER OF THE HOUSE, an enormous box-office success in its day, is a jewel of the silent cinema."

Kaurismäki took his penchant for despairing character studies to unspeakably grim depths in the shockingly entertaining The Match Factory Girl. Kati Outinen is memorably impenetrable as Iris, whose grinding days as a cog in a factory wheel, and nights as a neglected daughter living with her parents, ultimately send her over the edge. Yet despite her transgressions, Kaurismäki makes Iris a compelling, even sympathetic figure. Bleak yet suffused with comic irony, The Match Factory Girl closes out the &quot;Proletariat Trilogy&quot; with a bang, and a whimper."

A slow-burning depiction of economic degradation in Thatcher’s England, Mike Leigh’s MEANTIME is the culmination of the writer-director’s pioneering work in television. Unemployment is rampant in London’s working-class East End, where a middle-aged couple and their two sons languish in a claustrophobic public-housing flat. As the brothers (Phil Daniels and Tim Roth) grow increasingly disaffected, Leigh punctuates the grinding boredom of their daily existence with tense encounters, including with a priggish aunt (Marion Bailey) who has managed to become middle-class and a blithering skinhead on the verge of psychosis (a scene-stealing Gary Oldman, in his first major role). Informed by Leigh’s now trademark improvisational process and propelled by the lurching rhythms of its Beckett-like dialogue, MEANTIME is an unrelenting, often blisteringly funny look at life on the dole."

Melding Western myth with aesthetic and musical influences from numerous world cultures, Pasolini fashions a mesmerizing cinematic pageant that gathers in force until it explodes in rage and a stunningly nihilistic condemnation of injustice."

In 1970, a British film crew set out to make a straightforward literary portrait of James Baldwin set in Paris, insisting on setting aside his political activism.

Directed by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea • 1968 • Cuba
Starring Sergio Corrieri, Daisy Granados, Omar Valdés

This film by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea is the most renowned work in the history of Cuban cinema. After his wife and family flee in the wake of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the bourgeois intellectual Sergio (Sergio Corrieri) passes his days wandering Havana in idle reflection, his amorous entanglements and political ambivalence gradually giving way to a mounting sense of alienation. With this adaptation of an innovative novel by Edmundo Desnoes, Gutiérrez Alea developed a cinematic style as radical as the times he was chronicling, creating a collage of vivid impressions through the use of experimental editing techniques, archival material, and spontaneously shot street scenes. Intimate and densely layered, MEMORIES OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT provides an indictment of its protagonist’s disengagement and an extraordinary glimpse of life in postrevolutionary Cuba.

Fassbinder had gained acclaim for a series of trenchant, quickly made early films, but for this one he took more time and forged a new style—featuring a more complexly woven script and narrative structure and more sophisticated use of the camera, and influenced by the work of his recently discovered idol, Douglas Sirk.

The film draws the viewer through the artist’s lush garden and ornate home, into the martial arts dojo in his backyard and the laboratory in his basement—all just blocks from where he grew up in the housing projects of South Jamaica, Queens. Graves tells stories of discovery, struggle, and survival, ruminates on the essence of “swing,” activates electronic stethoscopes in his basement lab to process the sound of his heart, and travels to Japan to perform at a school for children with autism. Oscillating from present to past and weaving intimate glimpses of the artist’s complex cosmology with blistering performances, MILFORD GRAVES FULL MANTIS is cinema full of fluidity, polyrhythm, and intensity, embodying the essence of Graves’s music."

Audiences will begin to grasp what they are in for early on as loser Nishi, too wimpy to try to save his childhood sweetheart from gangsters, is shot in the rear end by a soccer-playing psychopath, projecting Nishi into the afterlife.

With makeshift lighting and costuming, the men fabricate the apparition of Saint Dismas, whose appearance every Thursday night drums up publicity for the spa’s purportedly healing waters. But as the news spreads and tourism begins to spike, a mysterious outsider arrives in town, threatening to reveal the miracle as a hoax.

A subtly ravishing passage through the halls of time and memory, this sublime reflection on twentieth-century Russian history by Andrei Tarkovsky (STALKER) is as much a poem composed in images, or a hypnagogic hallucination, as it is a work of cinema. In a richly textured collage of varying film stocks and newsreel footage, the recollections of a dying poet flash before our eyes, his dreams mingling with scenes of childhood, wartime, and marriage, all imbued with the mystical power of a trance. Largely dismissed by Soviet critics on its release because of its elusive narrative structure, MIRROR has since taken its place as one of the director’s most renowned and influential works, a stunning personal statement from an artist transmitting his innermost thoughts and feelings directly from psyche to screen."

Taking place on Mishima&#39;s last day, when he famously committed public seppuku, the film is punctuated by extended flashbacks to the writer&#39;s life as well as by gloriously stylized evocations of his fictional works.

George’s fascination with the elegant, enigmatic Simone leads him on a dangerous quest through the city’s underbelly, where love is a weakness to be exploited and betrayed. Jordan’s colorful dialogue and eye for evocatively surreal details lend a dreamlike sheen to MONA LISA, an unconventionally romantic tale of damaged people searching for tenderness in an unforgiving world."

French screen icons Jean Gabin and Jean-Paul Belmondo star opposite each other in this captivating, booze-soaked comedy based on a novel by Antoine Blondin. Years earlier, inn owner Albert (Gabin) made a promise that if he and his wife survived the war he would never drink again. But his spell of sobriety is tested when he meets Gabriel (Belmondo), a hard-drinking advertising executive who checks into his hotel and with whom he soon forms a bond. Under the influence of the charming younger man, Albert joins him on an epic, alcohol-fueled escapade."

Directed by Jacques Tati • 1958 • France, Italy
Starring Jacques Tati, Jean-Pierre Zola, Adrienne Servantie

Slapstick prevails again when Jacques Tati’s eccentric, old-fashioned hero, Monsieur Hulot, is set loose in Villa Arpel, the geometric, oppressively ultramodern home of his brother-in-law, and in the antiseptic plastic hose factory where he gets a job. The second Hulot movie and Tati’s first color film, MON ONCLE is a supremely amusing satire of mechanized living and consumer society that earned the director the Academy Award for best foreign-language film."

Claude Jutra’s evocative portrait of a boy’s coming of age in wintry 1940s rural Quebec has been consistently cited by critics and scholars as the greatest Canadian film of all time. Delicate, naturalistic, and tinged with a striking mix of nostalgia and menace, MON ONCLE ANTOINE follows Benoit, as he first encounters the twin terrors of sex and death, and his fellow villagers, who are living under the thumb of the local asbestos mine owner. Set during one ominous Christmas, MON ONCLE ANTOINE is a holiday film unlike any other, and an authentically detailed illustration of childhood’s twilight."

Monsieur Hulot, Jacques Tati’s endearing clown, takes a holiday at a seaside resort, where his presence provokes one catastrophe after another. Tati’s masterpiece of gentle slapstick is a series of effortlessly well-choreographed sight gags involving dogs, boats, and firecrackers; it was the first entry in the Hulot series and the film that launched its maker to international stardom."

When Jude ends up unexpectedly living at home in their thirties, they must deal with a lovingly opinionated Jewish mother who doesn’t quite get the whole “trans thing.” Shot in the dog days of quarantine during a picturesque Vermont summer, MONSIEUR LE BUTCH is a tender comedy about the line between the stories we tell ourselves and the stories that get told about us."

Charlie Chaplin plays shockingly against type in his most controversial film, a brilliant and bleak black comedy about money, marriage, and murder. Chaplin is a twentieth-century bluebeard, an enigmatic family man who goes to extreme lengths to support his wife and child, attempting to bump off a series of wealthy widows (including one played by the indefatigable Martha Raye, in a hilarious performance). This deeply philosophical and wildly entertaining film is a work of true sophistication, both for the moral questions it dares to ask and for the way it deconstructs its megastar’s lovable on-screen persona."

On a beautiful June weekend in 1967, at the beginning of the Summer of Love, the Monterey International Pop Festival roared forward, capturing a decade’s spirit and ushering in a new era of rock and roll. Monterey featured career-making performances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Otis Redding, but they were just a few of the performers in a wildly diverse lineup that included Simon and Garfunkel, the Mamas and the Papas, the Who, the Byrds, Hugh Masekela, and the extraordinary Ravi Shankar. With his characteristic vérité style—and a camera crew that included the likes of Albert Maysles and Richard Leacock—D. A. Pennebaker captured it all, immortalizing moments that have become legend: Pete Townshend smashing his guitar, Jimi Hendrix burning his, Mama Cass watching Janis Joplin’s performance in awe."

For her second film, Kinuyo Tanaka directed a script by legendary collaborator and mentor Yasujiro Ozu. Though informed by Ozu’s singular take on familial relationships, THE MOON HAS RISEN also possesses Tanaka’s lively and elegant comedic sensibility in its depiction of a widower (Chishu Ryu) who lives with his three daughters (Hisako Yamane, Yoko Sugi, and Mie Kitahara). As several young men court the women, their father is forced to confront—with amusing bewilderment—Japanese society’s rapidly evolving mores."

Told from the point of view of the family’s teenage daughter (Kyoko Kagawa), MOTHER offers a convincingly realistic evocation of a young woman’s perspective as she experiences joy and heartbreak in equal measure."

In his long-unavailable body of work, ranging from documentaries about his native village to closely autobiographical narrative films, Eustache pioneered a forthright and fearless brand of realism. The pinnacle of this innovative style, THE MOTHER AND THE WHORE follows Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a Parisian pseudo-intellectual who lives with his tempestuous girlfriend, Marie (Bernadette Lafont), even as he begins a dalliance with the sexually liberated Veronika (Françoise Lebrun), leading the three into an emotionally turbulent love triangle. Through daringly sustained long takes and confessional dialogue, Eustache captures a generation navigating the disillusionment of the 1970s, and in the process achieves an intimacy so deep it cuts."

Starring Alain Delon, Jeanne Moreau, Francine Bergé

Neglected for decades, this chilling existentialist mystery has reemerged as one of director Joseph Losey’s most virtuosic works. In perhaps the finest performance of his career, Alain Delon stars as the wealthy Robert Klein, an amoral art dealer in Nazi-occupied Paris who exploits the persecution of his Jewish countrymen by buying and selling their paintings. When Klein is mistaken for a Jewish man of the same name, he is plunged into a labyrinthine identity crisis with life-or-death consequences. Through his moody, mesmerizing visual style, Losey weaves a Kafkaesque web of steadily mounting paranoia."

Hiroshi Shimizu&#39;s endearing road movie follows the long and winding route of a sweet-natured bus driver, nicknamed Mr. Thank You for his constant exclamation to pedestrians who kindly step out of his way, traveling from rural Izu to Tokyo. Romance and comedy occur, and tragedy threatens his passengers, a virtual microcosm of depression-era Japan."

The film that, along with producer Sammo Hung’s SPOOKY ENCOUNTERS, launched an entire hopping-vampire horror-comedy subgenre is Hong Kong cinema at its most gleefully inventive and gloriously unrestrained. The franchise’s recurring star Lam Ching-Ying plays a unibrowed Taoist priest who, when a bloodthirsty revivified corpse pogoes its way out of the grave and begins terrorizing his town, must use a mix of magic and kung fu to stop the mayhem. Unfortunately, his two bumbling assistants (Ricky Hui and Chin Siu-Ho) cause nearly as much trouble as the bouncing bloodsucker."

The first of the numerous sequels to follow in the wake of the blockbuster success of MR. VAMPIRE puts a fresh twist on the hopping-vampire mythology by bringing the bounding baddies into the present day. Here, supernatural hijinks ensue when an archaeologist inadvertently awakens an ancient vampire family, sending the revivified mom, dad, and son on a rip-roaring rampage—with much hilarity provided by the epic, slow-motion centerpiece fight sequence. Lam Ching-Ying returns as the chief vampire slayer, alongside a cast that includes HK cinema greats Yuen Biao and James Tien."

The third installment of the unstoppable MR. VAMPIRE series offers up some of the wildest gags and most eye-popping action in the entire franchise. This time around, we follow the exploits of charlatan ghost hunter Uncle Ming (Richard Ng), who makes money performing phony exorcisms with the help of his two spirit companions. He’ll have to summon real powers, though, to deal with an evil witch (Pauline Wong Yuk-Wan) whose supernatural bandits are terrorizing a village. A deep-fried ghost, maggot-spewing sorceresses, full-frontal Richard Ng nudity, and a Sammo Hung cameo are all part of the nonstop, endlessly inventive fun."

The fourth MR. VAMPIRE film may just be the most gloriously goofy of the bunch—and that’s saying something. Leaning heavily into the unrepentantly silly comedy that always made the series so much fun, this installment brings us a pair of neighboring priests—one Taoist (Anthony Chan), one Buddhist (Wu Ma)—who must put aside their constant feuding in order to take on a horde of hopping vampire invaders. Though it is the only installment in the series not to feature regular star Lam Ching-Ying, MR. VAMPIRE IV delivers more than enough zany-spooky pleasures to make it yet another worthy follow-up."

Audrey Benac—the recurring fictional alter ego of filmmaker Sofia Bohdanowicz, played by codirector Deragh Campbell—returns in this by turns wry and reflective investigation into hidden family histories. Here, Audrey is launched on a surprising odyssey when she travels to Harvard’s Houghton Library to read the archived letters that her great-grandmother, Zofia Bohdanowiczowa, exchanged with fellow Polish poet Jozef Wittlin between 1957 and 1964. As she digs into the past, Audrey encounters resistance both institutional and familial while grappling with her own precarious present reality."

When Toshio&#39;s father dies, Matsu becomes a surrogate father, helping to raise the boy and secretly falling in love with Toshio&#39;s mother Yoshioko.

The gloriously grotesque second feature directed by John Waters is replete with all manner of depravity, from robbery to murder to one of cinema’s most memorably blasphemous moments. Made on a shoestring budget in Waters’ native Baltimore, with the filmmaker taking on nearly every technical task, this gleeful mockery of the peace-and-love ethos of its era features the Cavalcade of Perversion, a traveling show mounted by a troupe of misfits whose shocking proclivities are topped only by those of their leader: the glammer-than-glam, larger-than-life Divine, out for blood after discovering her lover’s affair. Starring Waters’ beloved regular cast the Dreamlanders (including David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Mink Stole, Susan Lowe, George Figgs, and Cookie Mueller), MULTIPLE MANIACS is an anarchic masterwork from an artist who has doggedly tested the limits of good taste for decades."

Alain Resnais&#39;s MURIEL, OR THE TIME OF RETURN, the director&#39;s follow-up to LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, is as radical a reflection on the nature of time and memory as its predecessor. The always luminous Delphine Seyrig stars as an antique shop owner and widow in Boulogne-sur-Mer, whose past comes back to haunt her when a former lover reenters her life. Meanwhile, her stepson is tormented by his own ghosts, related to his service in France&#39;s recently ended war in Algeria. Featuring a multilayered script by Jean Cayrol and inventively edited to evoke its middle-class characters&#39; political and personal realities, the fragmented, emotionally powerful MURIEL reminds viewers that the past is always present."

Johann (Bobby Sommer), a museum guard, spends his days silently observing both the art and the visitors. Anne (Mary Margaret O’Hara), suddenly called to Vienna from overseas, has been wandering the city in a state of limbo. A chance meeting sparks a deepening connection that draws them through the halls of the museum and the streets of the city. The exquisitely photographed MUSEUM HOURS is an ode to the bonds of friendship, an exploration of an unseen Vienna, and the power of art to both mirror and alter our lives."

His greatest joy is the music room in which he has hosted lavish concerts over the years—now a shadow of its former vivid self.

A trio of people (Gérard Depardieu, Nicole Garcia, Roger Pierre) are presented as “case histories” by a lecturer—and we see them not only in their work environments, but also in terms of the cinematic role models (Jean Gabin, Jean Marais, Danielle Darrieux) that have helped shape their self-images."

The riveting narrative takes us from the men’s room in Penn Station, where Kahn died bankrupt and alone, to the bustling streets of Bangladesh, the inner sanctums of Jerusalem politics, and unforgettable encounters with the world’s most celebrated architects. In a documentary with all the emotional impact of a dramatic feature film, Nathaniel’s journey becomes a universal investigation of identity—and a celebration of art and, ultimately, life itself."

Headstrong young Sybylla Melvyn (Judy Davis, in a star-making performance), bemoans her stifling life in the backcountry, where her writerly ambitions receive little encouragement, and craves independence above all else. When a handsome landowner (Sam Neill), disarmed by her unruly charms, begins to court her, Sybylla must decide whether she can reconcile the prospect of marriage with the illustrious life’s work she has imagined for herself. Suffused with generous humor and a youthful appetite for experience, MY BRILLIANT CAREER is a luminous portrait of an ardently free spirit."

With deliriously pulpy plotting, a synth-heavy score, luxuriously expressionistic imagery, and a climactic bloodbath for the ages, MY HEART IS THAT ETERNAL ROSE exists somewhere at the intersection of Wong’s cinema of longing and John Woo’s cinema of wrathful vengeance, standing as one of the high-water marks of Hong Kong crime cinema."

In MY NIGHT AT MAUD’s, the brilliantly accomplished centerpiece of the Six Moral Tales series, Jean-Louis Trintignant plays Jean-Louis, one of the great conflicted figures of 1960s cinema. A Catholic engineer in his early thirties, he lives by a strict moral code and immerses himself in mathematics and the philosophy of Blaise Pascal.

They play a young couple who agree to an arranged marriage in order to receive an uncle’s inheritance. While they initially plan to split up right after collecting the money, they gradually find themselves developing real feelings for each other during the course of a surprising honeymoon.

Arnaud Desplechin was heralded as a leading light of post–New Wave French cinema for this rich, sprawling look at the intertwining love lives of a coterie of Parisian academics. In a breakout performance that won him a César Award for most promising actor, Mathieu Amalric stars as Paul Dedalus, a hopelessly self-absorbed graduate student ping-ponging between lovers as he struggles to complete his thesis and break things off once and for all with his longtime girlfriend (Emmanuelle Devos).

Apichatpong Weerasethakul brought an appetite for experimentation to Thai cinema with his debut feature, an uncategorizable work that refracts documentary impressions of his homeland through the surrealist concept of the exquisite corpse game. Enlisting locals to contribute improvised narration to a simple tale, Apichatpong charts the collective construction of the fiction as each new encounter imbues it with unpredictable shades of fantasy and pathos. Shot over the course of two years in 16 mm black and white, MYSTERIOUS OBJECT AT NOON established the director’s fascination with the porous boundaries between the real and the imagined.

In 1955, Henri-Georges Clouzot joined forces with his friend Pablo Picasso to make an entirely new kind of art film, “a film that could capture the moment and the mystery of creativity.” Together, they devised an innovative technique: the filmmaker placed his camera behind a semitransparent surface on which the artist drew with special inks that bled through. Clouzot thus captured a perfect reverse image of Picasso’s brushstrokes, turning the motion-picture screen into the artist’s canvas. Here, the master creates, and sometimes obliterates, twenty works (most of them, in fact, destroyed after the shoot), ranging from playful black-and-white sketches to vivid color murals. Exhilarating, mesmerizing, enchanting, and unforgettable, THE MYSTERY OF PICASSO is simply one of the greatest documentaries on art ever made."

Made with its director’s customary precision and wit, this triptych of stories pays playful tribute to the home of Stax Records, Sun Studio, Graceland, Carl Perkins, and, of course, the King, who presides over the film like a spirit. MYSTERY TRAIN is one of Jarmusch’s very best movies, a boozy and beautiful pilgrimage to an iconic American ghost town and a paean to the music it gave the world."

A singularly affecting cross between documentary, fiction, family portrait, and detective story, NEVER EAT ALONE casts director Sofia Bohdanowicz’s own grandmother, Joan Benac, as a version of herself, an elderly woman who enlists the help of her granddaughter (Deragh Campbell in the first of her many appearances as the filmmaker’s alter ego, Audrey Benac) to help her find a former lover, a man with whom she once starred in a television show in the 1950s. The shared quest of these two women sheds light on both long-lost histories and the relationship between memory, time, and aging."

Starring Sally Forrest, Keefe Brassellle, Hugh O’Brian

With the polio epidemic striking terror in the hearts of millions—in 1949, it caused more than 2,700 deaths in the U.S. alone—Ida Lupino made this semiautobiographical melodrama about a dancer-choreographer (Sally Forrest) who struggles to overcome the disease that has crippled her body and her confidence. The film’s unusually hard-eyed realism was born of Lupino’s own dark memories of polio as an aspiring teenage actress, as well as her use of documentary locations and nonprofessional actors—most tenderly in the famous wheelchair square dance filmed (by veteran John Ford cinematographer Archie Stout) with actual rehab patients at the Kabat-Kaiser Institute in Santa Monica."

Brilliantly directed by Carlos Hugo Christensen with extraordinary cinematography by Pablo Tabernero, these twin tales of fate and chance, good and evil—one about a man out to avenge his sister’s suicide, the other about a blind mother’s dangerous reunion with her criminal son—are among the most evocative realizations of Woolrich ever produced, drenched in expressionist atmospherics and studded with masterful sequences of sustained suspense."

Following her time living in New York in the early 1970s, Chantal Akerman returned to the city to create one of her most elegantly minimalist and profoundly affecting meditations on dislocation and estrangement. Over a series of exactingly composed shots of Manhattan circa 1976, the filmmaker reads letters sent by her mother years earlier. The juxtaposition between the intimacy of these domestic reports and the lonely, bleakly beautiful cityscapes results in a poignant reflection on personal and familial disconnection that doubles as a transfixing time capsule."

Shot outside Pittsburgh on a shoestring budget, by a band of filmmakers determined to make their mark, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, directed by horror master George A. Romero, is a great story of independent cinema: a midnight hit turned box-office smash that became one of the most influential films of all time. A deceptively simple tale of a group of strangers trapped in a farmhouse who find themselves fending off a horde of recently dead, flesh-eating ghouls, Romero’s claustrophobic vision of a late-1960s America literally tearing itself apart rewrote the rules of the horror genre, combined gruesome gore with acute social commentary, and quietly broke ground by casting a black actor (Duane Jones) in its lead role. Stark, haunting, and more relevant than ever, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is back.

Lyolya, Dmitriy&#39;s girl friend, feels that their relationship means little to him and decides to marry their best friend, theoretician Ilya Kulikov.

One of the world’s great cinematic artists, Jafar Panahi has been carefully crafting self-reflexive works about artistic, personal, and political freedom for the past three decades, despite being banned from filmmaking by the Iranian government since 2010. In NO BEARS—completed shortly before his imprisonment in 2022—Panahi plays a fictionalized version of himself, a dissident filmmaker who relocates to a rural border town to direct a film remotely in nearby Turkey and finds himself embroiled in a local scandal. As he struggles to complete his film, Panahi must confront the opposing pulls of tradition and progress, city and country, belief and evidence, and the universal desire to reject oppression.

“Over a decade ago, in 2010, Jafar Panahi was sentenced to six years in prison and a twenty-year ban on directing films. He has, in the time since, directed five features; the unfathomable difficulty of this feat is as astonishing as how vital and how good his work continues to be.

Starring Jean-Charles Clichet, Noémie Lvovsky, Iliès Kadri

Director Alain Guiraudie’s typically subversive spin on the Gallic sex farce blends ribald comedy with sharp social satire for a provocative and unpredictable look at everything from sexism to Islamophobia in contemporary France. In the city of Clermont-Ferrand, Médéric (Jean-Charles Clichet) meets and falls in love with the married, middle-aged sex worker Isadora (Noémie Lvovsky). When the city center is rocked by a terrorist attack, Selim (Ilies Kadri), a young homeless man, provokes a wave of anti-Muslim paranoia by taking refuge in Médéric’s building. Sympathetic to Selim, crazy about Isadora, Médéric sees his life spin suddenly out of control."

In 1964, author Samuel Beckett set out on one of the strangest ventures in cinematic history: his embattled collaboration with silent-era genius Buster Keaton on the production of a short, untitled avant-garde film. Beckett was nearing the peak of his fame, which would culminate in his receiving a Nobel Prize five years later. Keaton, in his waning years, would not live to see Beckett’s canonization. The film they made along with director Alan Schneider, renegade publisher Barney Rosset, and Academy Award–winning cinematographer Boris Kaufman has been the subject of praise, condemnation, and controversy for decades. Yet the eclectic participants are just one part of a story that stretches to the birth of cinema and encompasses our very understanding of human consciousness. NOTFILM is the feature-length movie on FILM’s production and its philosophical implications, utilizing additional outtakes, never-before-heard audio recordings of the production meetings, and other rare archival elements."

Starring James Mason, Kathleen Ryan, Robert Newton

Taking place largely over the course of one tense night, Carol Reed’s psychological noir, set in an unnamed Belfast, stars James Mason as a revolutionary ex-con leading a robbery that goes horribly wrong. Injured and hunted by the police, he seeks refuge throughout the city, while the woman he loves (Kathleen Ryan) searches for him among the shadows. Reed and cinematographer Robert Krasker (who would collaborate again on THE THIRD MAN) create images of stunning depth for this fierce, spiritual depiction of a man’s ultimate confrontation with himself."

Starring Ganjiro Nakamura, Machiko Kyo

Kon Ichikawa’s ODD OBSESSION is a strange dark comedy on a then-forbidden subject—impotence, and jealousy as a cure for it. The movie explores the links between love, jealousy, and rage, all from the standpoint of Kenji Kenmochi (Ganjiro Nakamura), the middle-aged husband of the younger Ikuko (Machiko Kyo), who finds her youth intimidating to the point of sexual paralysis. His solution involves introducing his daughter’s lover to Ikuko."

Starring Harry Belafonte, Robert Ryan, Shelley Winters

Star Harry Belafonte produced this gritty, New York–set noir, which doubles as both a tense heist thriller and an X-ray of 1950s racial tensions. In need of quick money, fallen former cop David Burke (Ed Begley) recruits hard-bitten ex-con Earl Slater (Robert Ryan) and debt-ridden nightclub singer Johnny Ingram (Belafonte) to pull off a bank job. But as the animosity between Johnny and the racist Slater boils over, the entire plan threatens to implode. Written by blacklisted filmmaker Abraham Polonsky (FORCE OF EVIL) and featuring a moody jazz score by John Lewis of the Modern Jazz Quartet, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW was selected by no less than French crime master Jean-Pierre Melville as one of his all-time favorite films."

Pier Paolo Pasolini’s powerfully iconoclastic take on Sophocles’s tragedy blends eras and cultures to create a searing exploration of fate, free will, and the things we fear most in ourselves. Shot amid the stark, elemental landscapes of the Moroccan desert, and set in an indefinable ancient past, this bold reimagining casts the filmmaker’s frequent collaborator Franco Citti as the eponymous foundling, whose willful blindness to his own nature unleashes a cataclysmic reckoning. With a prologue and epilogue set in twentieth-century Italy, Pasolini connects the story to his own upbringing, daring to bare his soul on-screen."

Carlos Saura returns to the potent themes of trauma and repression that run through nearly all of his 1970s films that deal, in one way or another, with the psychological effects of authoritarianism. Geraldine Chaplin delivers an arresting performance as an actor playing a victim of torture in a play based in part on the 1976 Argentine coup d’état, who becomes romantically involved with the show’s director Luis (José Luis Gómez).

Two old friends reunite for a quietly revelatory overnight camping trip in this breakout feature from Kelly Reichardt, a microbudget study of character and masculinity that introduced many viewers to one of contemporary American cinema’s most independent artists. As expectant father Mark (Daniel London) and nomadic Kurt (Will Oldham) travel by car and foot into the woods in search of some secluded hot springs, their fumbling attempts to reconnect keep butting up against the limits of their friendship and the reality of how much their paths have diverged since their shared youth. Adapted from a short story by Jonathan Raymond and accompanied by an atmospheric Yo La Tengo score, OLD JOY is a contemplative, wryly observed triumph whose modest scale belies the richness of its insight."

Over the course of a long, rambling walk through the city, they bicker, reminisce, and reflect on their lives spent in service of white people: he as a servant, she as a practitioner of black magic for white clients.

Li displays his stunning, fast-and-fluid fighting style as the legendary martial-arts teacher and doctor Wong Fei-hung, who, with a band of disciples, battles a host of nefarious forces—foreign and local—who are threatening Chinese sovereignty as British and American imperialists encroach upon the Mainland.

Jet Li returns to the role of Wong Fei-hung, who here takes on the diabolical White Lotus Sect, a virulently xenophobic cult whose antiforeigner sentiments unleash a wave of destructive violence.

Starring Michel Piccoli, Marcello Mastroianni, Henri Garcin

A celebration of cinema’s centennial, ONE HUNDRED AND ONE NIGHTS finds Agnès Varda at her most playful. It is also perhaps her unlikeliest project: a star-studded comic fantasy with an extravagant sense of style and an adoring but slightly off-kilter perspective on the magic of filmmaking. French New Wave icon Michel Piccoli is a mysterious aging impresario named Simon Cinéma who has hired a young film student, Camille (Julie Gayet), to simply sit with him at his mansion and talk about movies. Skeptical yet increasingly enchanted, Camille bears witness to cinema itself coming to life, allowing Varda to wittily integrate a mind-boggling parade of appearances by screen legends (Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anouk Aimée, Robert De Niro, and many others), and attest to the vigorous health of the movies at the close of the twentieth century."

Paolo Sorrentino’s feature directorial debut finds him already exploring his signature themes of celebrity, masculinity, and moral corruption via an incisive dual portrait of two similarly named men who ascend to the heights of fame amid the sordid world of 1980s Naples. While Tony Pisapia (Toni Servillo) finds success as a singer of cheesy pop songs, Antonio Pisapia (Andrea Renzi) achieves glory on the soccer field—until drugs, scandal, and tragedy upend both their careers and force them to fight their way back into the spotlight."

In the early 1960s in Paris, two young women become friends. Pomme is an aspiring singer. Suzanne is a pregnant country girl unable to support a third child. Pomme lends Suzanne the money for an illegal abortion, but a sudden tragedy soon separates them. Ten years later, they reunite at a demonstration and pledge to keep in touch via postcard, as each of their lives is irrevocably changed by the women’s liberation movement. A buoyant hymn to sisterly solidarity rooted in the hard-won victories of a generation of women, ONE SINGS, THE OTHER DOESN’T is one of Agnès Varda’s warmest and most politically trenchant films, a feminist musical for the ages."

The only feature from the radical Afro-Cuban filmmaker Sara Gómez—who also worked as an assistant director with Agnès Varda and Tomás Gutiérrez Alea before her untimely death at age thirty-one—is an extraordinary portrait of postrevolution Cuba. Blending invaluable documentary footage with a loose narrative about the budding relationship between an outspoken schoolteacher (Yolanda Cuellar) and a young worker (Mario Balmaseda) facing a moral crisis, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER depicts revolution as an ongoing process that takes place at the level of community—among friends, lovers, coworkers, teachers, students, and parents, all of whom must work together to negotiate a new social order. Above all, Gómez offers a trenchant intersectional critique of the lingering sexism and machismo that, she argues, must be cleared away in order to create a truly just society."

Deep within the wind-swept marshes of war-torn medieval Japan, an impoverished mother and her daughter-in-law eke out a lonely, desperate existence. Forced to murder lost samurai and sell their belongings for grain, they dump the corpses down a deep, dark hole and live off their meager spoils. When a bedraggled neighbor returns from the skirmishes, lust, jealousy, and rage threaten to destroy the trio’s tenuous existence, before an ominous, ill-gotten demon mask seals the trio’s horrifying fate. Driven by primal emotions, dark eroticism, a frenzied score by Hikaru Hayashi, and stunning images both lyrical and macabre, Kaneto Shindo’s chilling folktale ONIBABA is a singular cinematic experience."

“Come, come! I’m sick to death of this particular self. I want another.” Taking Virginia Woolf’s novel “Orlando: A Biography” as his starting point, academic virtuoso turned filmmaker Paul B. Preciado fashioned the documentary ORLANDO, MY POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY—a personal essay, historical analysis, and social manifesto. For almost a century, Woolf’s eponymous hero(ine) has inspired readers with their gender fluidity as well as their physical and spiritual metamorphoses across a three-hundred-year span. In making his film, Preciado invited a diverse group of more than twenty trans and nonbinary people to play the role of Orlando and to participate in this shared biography. Together, they perform interpretations of the novel, weaving into Woolf’s narrative their own stories of transition and identity formation. Not content to simply update a groundbreaking work, Preciado interrogates the relevance of “Orlando” in the ongoing struggle to secure dignity for trans people worldwide."

Seeking inspiration, the poet follows the princess from the world of the living to the land of the dead, through Cocteau’s famous mirrored portal. ORPHEUS’s peerless visual poetry and dreamlike storytelling represent the legendary Cocteau at the height of his powers."

Taking Wittgenstein’s assertion that the most profound problems can only be discussed in the form of jokes as a starting point, OS HUMORES ARTIFICIAIS (“The Artificial Humors”) combines old-Hollywood aesthetics with documentary strategies to create a unique exploration of the anthropology of humor, indigenous identity, and artificial intelligence.

The first film in Pedro Costa&#39;s transformative trilogy about Fontainhas, an impoverished quarter of Lisbon, OSSOS is a tale of young lives torn apart by desperation. After a suicidal teenage girl gives birth, she misguidedly entrusts her baby&#39;s safety to the troubled, deadbeat father, whose violent actions take the viewer on a tour of the foreboding, crumbling shantytown in which they live. With its reserved, shadowy cinematography by Emmanuel Machuel (who collaborated with Bresson on L&#39;argent), OSSOS is a haunting look at a devastated community."

Gloriously cinematic despite its tiny budget, Orson Welles’s OTHELLO is a testament to the filmmaker’s stubborn willingness to pursue his vision to the ends of the earth. Unmatched in his passionate identification with Shakespeare’s imagination, Welles brings his inventive visual approach to this enduring tragedy of jealousy, bigotry, and rage, and also gives a towering performance as the Moor of Venice, alongside Suzanne Cloutier as the innocent Desdemona, and Micheál MacLiammóir as the scheming Iago. Shot over the course of three years in Italy and Morocco and plagued by many logistical problems, this fiercely independent film joins MACBETH and CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT in making the case for Welles as the cinema’s most audacious interpreter of the Bard."

Directed by Aki Kaurismäki • 2017 • Finland
Starring Sherwan Haji, Sakari Kuosmanen

This wry, melancholic comedy from Aki Kaurismäki, a response to the ongoing global refugee crisis, follows two people searching for a place to call home. Khaled (Sherwan Haji), a displaced Syrian, lands in Helsinki as a stowaway; meanwhile, middle-aged Finnish salesman Wikström (Sakari Kuosmanen) leaves his wife and his job and buys a conspicuously unprofitable restaurant. Khaled is denied asylum but decides not to return to Aleppo, and the paths of the two men cross fortuitously. As deadpan as the best of the director&#39;s work, and with a deep well of empathy for its down-but-not-out characters (many of them played by members of Kaurismäki&#39;s loyal stock company), THE OTHER SIDE OF HOPE is a bittersweet celebration of pockets of human kindness in an unwelcoming world."

Nabila Ebeed—one of Egypt’s leading box-office stars of the ’80s and ’90s—plays the jealous, possessive matriarch of a rich family who will stop at nothing to destroy her son’s marriage to an intrepid investigative journalist chasing a story about corruption among wealthy elites that may just hit a bit too close to home.

Babetida Sadjo delivers a bravura performance as Marie, the head chef at a retirement home in small-town France, whose day-to-day life caring for residents, hanging out with her coworker and best friend, and teasing a potential new romance is disrupted by the arrival of Father Patrick (Souleymane Sy Savane), an African priest whom she recognizes from a terrifying episode in her homeland.

Directed by Julien Duvivier • 1946 • France
Starring Michel Simon, Viviane Romance, Paul Bernard 

Proud, eccentric, and antisocial, Monsieur Hire (Michel Simon) has always kept to himself. But after a woman turns up dead in the Paris suburb where he lives, he feels drawn to a pretty young newcomer to town (Viviane Romance), discovers that his neighbors are only too ready to suspect the worst of him, and is framed for the murder. Based on a novel by Georges Simenon, Julien Duvivier’s first film after his return to France from Hollywood finds the acclaimed poetic realist applying his consummate craft to darker, moodier ends. Propelled by its two deeply nuanced lead performances, the tensely noirish PANIQUE exposes the dangers of the knives-out mob mentality, delivering as well a pointed allegory for the behavior of Duvivier’s countrymen during the war."

Peter Bogdanovich revisits the lyrical strain of bittersweet nostalgia he tapped into in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW in this 1930s-set comedy about the unlikely partnership that develops between a smooth-talking Kansas con man (Ryan O’Neal) and a young girl (Tatum O’Neal) who may or may not be his daughter. The evocative monochrome cinematography by László Kovács and scene-stealing performance by Tatum O’Neal—who became the youngest person ever to win an Academy Award for her memorable turn opposite her real-life father—are among the pleasures of this sweetly unsentimental slice of dust-bowl Americana."

Created for Swedish television (with Ingmar Bergman’s legendary director of photography Gunnar Fischer serving as one of its cinematographers), PARADE is a touching career send-off that recalls its maker’s origins as a mime and theater performer."

The Nazi persecution of homosexuals may be one of the least-told stories of the Third Reich. Directed by Oscar winners Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, PARAGRAPH 175 fills a crucial gap in the historical record, and reveals the lasting consequences of this hidden chapter of twentieth-century history. These are stories of survivors—sometimes bitter, but just as often filled with irony and humor; tortured by their memories, yet infused with a powerful will to endure. Their moving testimonies, rendered with evocative images of their lives and times, tell a haunting, compelling story of human resistance. Intimate in its portrayals, sweeping in its implications, PARAGRAPH 175 raises provocative questions about memory, history, and identity."

One of the original critics turned filmmakers who helped jump-start the French New Wave, Jacques Rivette began shooting his debut feature in 1958, well before that cinema revolution officially kicked off with THE 400 BLOWS and BREATHLESS. Ultimately released in 1961, the rich and mysterious PARIS BELONGS TO US offers some of the radical flavor that would define the movement, with a particularly Rivettian twist. The film follows a young literature student (Betty Schneider) who befriends the members of a loose-knit group of twentysomethings in Paris, united by the apparent suicide of an acquaintance. Suffused with a lingering post-World War II disillusionment while also evincing the playfulness and fascination with theatrical performance and conspiracy that would become hallmarks for the director, PARIS BELONGS TO US marked the provocative start to a brilliant directorial career."

PARIS, TEXAS follows the mysterious, nearly mute drifter Travis (a magnificent Harry Dean Stanton, whose face is a landscape all its own) as he tries to reconnect with his young son, living with his brother (Dean Stockwell) in Los Angeles, and his missing wife (Nastassja Kinski).

In recent years, director Toshio Masuda has worked on the international stage with action-oriented movies such as Tora! Tora! Tora! and the Space Cruiser Yamato films. But he began his career in the middle-late 1950s with The Perfect Game (aka Kanzen Na Yuugi), a shockingly amoral tale of delinquency, rape, and murder that was to Japan, what In Cold Blood was to American cinema. It was among the earliest works in the career of a director who has generated little except major box office hits in Japan since the 1950s."

Catherine Breillat traces the shockingly violent disintegration of a May-December affair in PERFECT LOVE, arguably her most realistic and disturbing study of romance gone wrong. When twice-divorced optician Frédérique (Isabelle Renauld) falls for the much younger Christophe (Francis Renaud), whose insecurity is matched only by his unconscious need for manipulation and control, she eventually becomes addicted to their toxic relationship. Once more demonstrating a superlative ear for dialogue and a preternatural ability to elicit thunderous performances, Breillat delves into the psychological roots and consequences of codependency with the unflinching courage that has become her trademark."

Acclaimed by Werner Herzog as “one of the most original and poetic works of cinema made anywhere in the seventies,” this exhilaratingly imaginative DIY landmark of Filipino cinema stars director Kidlat Tahimik as a starry-eyed jitney driver obsessed with American culture (particularly its space program) who gets a crash course in the failures of globalization during a sojourn in Paris.

By the midsixties, Ingmar Bergman had already conjured many of the cinema’s most unforgettable images. But with the radical PERSONA, he attained new levels of visual poetry. In the first of a series of legendary performances for Bergman, Liv Ullmann plays a stage actor who has inexplicably gone mute; an equally mesmerizing Bibi Andersson is the garrulous young nurse caring for her in a remote island cottage. While isolated together there, the women undergo a mysterious spiritual and emotional transference. Performed with astonishing nuance and shot in stark contrast and soft light by Sven Nykvist, the influential PERSONA is a penetrating, dreamlike work of profound psychological depth."

Solange (Jade Springer, in a revelatory performance) is a typical thirteen-year-old, curious and full of life. When her parents begin to argue and gradually drift apart, Solange’s world splinters, leaving her increasingly isolated as she attempts to navigate this complicated new reality.

Before his convention-shattering debut, BREATHLESS, had even premiered, Jean-Luc Godard leapt into the making of his second feature, a thriller that would tackle the most controversial subject in France: the use of torture in the Algerian War. Despite his lack of political convictions, photojournalist Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor) is roped into a paramilitary group waging a shadow war in Geneva against the Algerian independence movement. Anna Karina (in her first collaboration with Godard, whose camera is visibly besotted with her) is beguiling as the mysterious woman with whom Forestier becomes infatuated. Banned for two and a half years by French censors for its depiction of brutal tactics on the part of the French government and the Algerian fighters alike, LE PETIT SOLDAT finds the young Godard already retooling cinema as a vehicle for existential inquiry, political argument, and ephemeral portraiture—in other words, as a medium for delivering “truth twenty-four times per second.”"

The story, based on a novel by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf, concerns an alcoholic, abusive ne’er-do-well (Sjöström himself) who is shown the error of his ways, and the pure-of-heart Salvation Army sister who believes in his redemption.

Starring Rachel Roberts, Vivean Gray, Helen Morse

This sensual and striking chronicle of a disappearance and its aftermath put director Peter Weir on the map and helped usher in a new era of Australian cinema. Based on an acclaimed 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK is set at the turn of the twentieth century and concerns a small group of students from an all-female college who vanish, along with a chaperone, while on a St. Valentine’s Day outing. Less a mystery than a journey into the mystic, as well as an inquiry into issues of class and sexual repression in Australian society, Weir’s gorgeous, disquieting film is a work of poetic horror whose secrets haunt viewers to this day."

The latest from acclaimed Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho (BACURAU, AQUARIUS) is a multidimensional journey across time, sound, architecture, and filmmaking that explores the rich, complicated history of the filmmaker’s home city of Recife—the coastal capital of the state of Pernambuco—through the great movie theaters that served as spaces of conviviality during the twentieth century. Paeans to dreams and progress, these temples of cinema have also come to reflect major shifts in Brazilian society and politics. Combining archival documentary, mystery, film clips, and personal memories, PICTURES OF GHOSTS is a map of a city through the lens of cinema, offering a delightful tour in the company of a master storyteller."

The classic story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin comes to life courtesy of French New Wave magician Jacques Demy. Psych-folk legend Donovan plays the titular, magic-flute-playing troubadour, who encounters greed and corruption when he arrives in a fourteenth-century German town in the grip of the Black Plague. Demy’s ever-imaginative costumes and production design and a surprising cast that includes John Hurt, Donald Pleasence, and Diana Dors provide some of the many pleasures in this offbeat blend of dark-tinged fairy tale, medieval pageantry, and flower-child bohemianism."

Jean Eustache returned to his hometown, the farming community of Pessac, to create this cinema-verité record of the ritual slaughter of a pig, codirected with Jean-Michel Barjol. The documentary captures in unflinching detail—and in beautifully unpolished black-and-white cinematography—the procedural killing, dismembering, and processing of the animal, resulting in a depiction of both the physical gruesomeness and artisanal craft of such work. THE PIG not only builds upon Eustache’s ethnographic representation of working-class customs and traditions in the previous year’s THE VIRGIN OF PESSAC but also develops the tough yet compassionate lens he would soon apply to his narrative features."

Formerly one of European cinema’s most iconic real-life couples, Alain Delon and Romy Schneider reunited for this film, bringing a palpable erotic chemistry to their performances as the bronzed and beautiful vacationers whose summer holiday on the Côte d’Azur is interrupted by the arrival of an old acquaintance (Maurice Ronet) and his eighteen-year-old daughter (Jane Birkin)—unleashing a gathering wave of sexual tension, jealousy, and sudden violence.

The brainchild of attention-hungry society women, the holiday initiative encourages wealthy citizens to break bread with the less fortunate—“if only for one night.” As the festivities devolve into a grotesque media frenzy, a struggling family man enlisted to help on the project desperately tries to make a payment on his three-wheeler before it is repossessed. Marking the start of Berlanga’s fruitful collaboration with screenwriter Rafael Azcona, this delightfully cacophonous takedown of upper-class hypocrisy unfolds in expertly choreographed long takes that showcase the director as a master of comedic mischief."

Les Blank considered this free-form feature documentary about beloved singer-songwriter Leon Russell, filmed between 1972 and 1974, to be one of his greatest accomplishments. Yet it has not been released until now. Hired by Russell to film him at his recording studio in northeast Oklahoma, Blank ended up constructing a unique, intimate portrait of a musician and his environment. Made up of mesmerizing scenes of Russell and his band performing, both in concert and in the studio, as well as off-the-cuff moments behind the scenes, this singular film - which also features performances by Willie Nelson and George Jones - has attained legendary status over the years. It&#39;s a work of rough beauty that serves as testament to Blank&#39;s cinematic daring and Russell&#39;s immense musical talents."

Korean cinema legend Yoon Jeong-hee delivers a stunning performance as Mija, an aging part-time maid and full-time guardian of her apathetic grandson (Lee Da-wit). Concerned by her frequent forgetfulness, she takes a poetry class at the local arts center to sharpen her mind.

Both a stylized depiction of the complicated relationship between a married couple (played by Silvia Monfort and Philippe Noiret) and a documentary-like look at the daily struggles of the locals, Varda’s discursive, gorgeously filmed debut was radical enough to later be considered one of the progenitors of the coming French New Wave."

The writer, actor, and director Sacha Guitry emerged from the theater to become one of France’s best-known and most inventive filmmakers, and LA POISON marked his first major collaboration with another titan of the screen, the incomparably expressive Michel Simon. With Guitry’s witty dialogue and fleet pacing, this black comedy is the quintessential depiction of a marriage gone sour: after thirty years together, a village gardener (Simon) and his wife (Germaine Reuver) find themselves contemplating how to do away with each other, with the former even planning how he’ll negotiate his eventual criminal trial. Inspired by Guitry’s own post–World War II tangle with the law—a wrongful charge of collaborationism—LA POISON is a blithely caustic broadside against the French legal system and a society all too eager to capitalize on the misfortunes of others."

The jaw-dropping set pieces fly fast and furious in Jackie Chan’s breathtakingly inventive martial-arts comedy, a smash hit that made him a worldwide icon of daredevil action spectacle. The director/star/one-man stunt machine plays Ka-Kui, a Hong Kong police inspector who goes rogue to bring down a drug kingpin and protect the case’s star witness (Chinese cinema legend Brigitte Lin) from retribution. Packed wall-to-wall with charmingly goofball slapstick and astoundingly acrobatic fight choreography—including an epic shopping-mall melee of flying fists and shattered glass—POLICE STORY set a new standard for rock-’em-sock-’em mayhem that would influence a generation of filmmakers from Hong Kong to Hollywood."

But it isn’t long before he’s back in action, racing the clock to stop a band of serial bombers and win back his much-put-upon girlfriend May (the phenomenal Maggie Cheung, reprising her star-making role). Boasting epic explosions, an awesomely 1980s electro soundtrack, and a showstopping finale—which turns an abandoned warehouse into a life-size pinball machine of cascading oil drums, collapsing scaffolds, and shooting fireworks—POLICE STORY 2 confirmed Chan’s status as a performer of unparalleled grace and daring."

But why? Just released from jail, Marie discovers that her boyfriend, Julien (Pierre Clémenti), is involved in a dangerous conspiracy and enlists the impulsive, combative Baptiste to help her unravel it.

“I killed my father. I ate human flesh. I quiver with joy.” Provocateur Pier Paolo Pasolini is at his most incendiary in PORCILE (“Pigsty”), a double-edged allegory on fascism, consumerism, and resistance. In one story, a defiant man (Pierre Clémenti) perpetrates increasingly barbaric acts while wandering a mythic, volcanic landscape. In the other, the scion (Jean-Pierre Léaud) of a wealthy, ex-Nazi industrial family conceals a shocking proclivity. Taken together, these stories of transgression form a scathing commentary on postwar European moral rot and the meaning of rebellion in the face of a corrupt world."

From time to time, Haru shares her bed with Subu, though she believes her dead husband, reincarnated as a carp, disapproves. Director Shohei Imamura has always delighted in the kinky exploits of lowlifes, and in this 1966 classic, he finds subversive humor in the bizarre dynamics of Haru, her Oedipal son, and her daughter, the true object of her pornographer-boyfriend’s obsession. Imamura’s comic treatment of such taboos as voyeurism and incest sparked controversy when the film was released, but THE PORNOGRAPHERS has outlasted its critics, and now seems frankly ahead of its time."

The last of the celebrated collaborations between director Marcel Carné and screenwriter Jacques Prévert (CHILDREN OF PARADISE) unfolds in a dreamily beautiful vision of a wintry, nocturnal Paris shortly after the city’s postwar liberation. It’s there that Jean Diego (Yves Montand in one of his first film roles), a former member of the French underground Resistance, has an encounter with destiny as he meets a long-lost comrade, villains of the war, a prophetic tramp, and a beautiful woman who will draw him into an inexorable tragedy. A richly allegorical evocation of a country reckoning with the guilt and national trauma of World War II and the occupation, LES PORTES DE LA NUIT (“The Gates of the Night”) was a tough sell for postwar audiences looking for escapism, but it can now be appreciated for both its haunting atmosphere and unique fusion of poetic fantasy and bitter reality."

Fate, however, has a different plan for him, as acts of both revenge and kindness render him front-page news. Also starring the blue-eyed phenomenon Michèle Morgan in her first major role, and the menacing Michel Simon, PORT OF SHADOWS starkly portrays an underworld of lonely souls wrestling with their own destinies.

The Porto of this childhood is a city laden with history, a city of artists and thinkers. As in a spiral, the film moves from the ruins of the house where the filmmaker was born to the streets of the city that, in 1896, saw the birth of cinema in Portugal.

Philbert (Gary Farmer), his easygoing friend, pursues Native wisdom and lore wherever he can find it—even on “Bonanza.” As the two set off on a journey to bail out Buddy’s imprisoned sister, Philbert’s gentle faith challenges Buddy’s hard-edged view of the world, and together they face the realities and dreams of being Cheyenne in the modern-day U.S."

Starring Herbert Norville, Oscar James, Frank Singuineau

The fiction debut by esteemed Trinidadian-British documentarian Horace Ové marked a watershed in the history of British cinema. This gripping and immersive drama was the nation’s first feature to be written and directed by a Black filmmaker, and the first to fully focus on the perspective of Black characters. Ové and novelist Sam Selvon’s gritty script centers on teenage Tony (Herbert Norville), caught between his Trinidadian parents’ (Lucita Lijertwood and Frank Singuineau) desire to attain middle-class respectability in London and his older brother Colin’s (Oscar James) urging to join the Black Power movement. After encountering racism while hanging out with a white girl and searching for employment, Tony finds comradeship with a group of aimless Caribbean boys, only to discover that their petty criminality is a dead end. Ové depicts Tony’s subsequent political awakening in captivating vérité style as he realizes that taking on the system will invite not only violent police oppression but also a thorough examination of his own values and beliefs. Suffused with the political outrage and explosive rebellion of 1970s London, PRESSURE is a marvel of lived-in independent filmmaking that captures Black working-class solidarity while refusing easy solutions to social problems—like income disparity, juvenile delinquency, racial profiling—that remain relevant today."

Starring Prince Adu, Karren Karagulian, Aiden Noesi

Staking out territory on the cold winter streets of midtown Manhattan, West African immigrant Lucky (Prince Adu) uses the gift of gab and a hustler’s shrewdness to peddle designer knockoffs for Lebanese store owner Levon (Karren Karagulian). One day, a long-forgotten ex named Linda (Kat Sanchez) delivers shocking news: years ago she had Lucky’s baby (Aiden Noesi) and now needs him to tend the toddler for several weeks—though Lucky suspects she’s using him to completely abdicate her parental responsibilities. Now Lucky must figure out how to become a father overnight without losing his girlfriend, Karina (Keyali Mayaga), or his edge in the counterfeit-merch game. Directed, photographed, edited, coproduced, and cowritten by Sean Baker, PRINCE OF BROADWAY scintillates with the live-wire energy of its mostly nonprofessional cast and the authenticity of its documentarylike production, shot on location in New York City. With this marvel of shoestring-budget guerrilla filmmaking, Baker deftly combines the streetwise and the heartfelt, proving himself one of the contemporary masters of American independent cinema."

Harkening back to the classic Ealing comedies, this shrewd social satire (scripted by Alan Bennett) features marvelous performances from Maggie Smith and Michael Palin as Joyce and Gilbert Chilvers, a husband and wife living through the stringent food rationing of post–World War II England. When the ambitious Joyce sees a chance to improve her social station by stealing an illegally raised pig (“Pork is power!”), she convinces the compliant Gilbert to abduct the swine.

Acclaimed actor Bob Hoskins made a striking directorial debut with this curiously captivating fable that plays freely with gender, fantasy, and magic. Stationed somewhere in Eastern Europe, a young soldier (Dexter Fletcher) defects after his sergeant is killed in battle. Shell-shocked, mute, and disguised in women’s clothing, he joins a traveling Romani caravan (with Hoskins himself playing the band’s leader) after they mistake him for a “rawney”—a vagabond female mystic able to foresee the future."

Vividly set amid New York City’s Dominican community, this warm, naturalistic slice-of-life is one of the brightest gems of early-2000s American independent cinema. Growing up on the Lower East Side, cocky teen Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk) must deal with both his eccentric family and his raging hormones. When his reputation as a ladies’ man takes a hit, Victor sets out to prove his swagger by winning over neighborhood beauty Judy (Judy Marte).

This witty, charming, and unusual documentary chronicles one of the most enduring rivalries in nature: man versus rat in their endless struggle to control New York City.

Marvel at the resilience of these rodents, while hearty New Yorkers share tales of battle and, in some cases, defeat. The cameras go on patrol with the city’s famed exterminators, then behind walls, through pipes, and deep into the New York underground to reveal the hidden world of these most cunning of creatures."

A period piece that forgoes nostalgia in favor of a stark examination of working-class struggle, Bo Widerberg’s second feature unfolds in 1936 in the director’s hometown of Malmö. It’s there, in the poor district of Raven’s End, that young Anders (Widerberg’s regular collaborator Tommy Berggren) chases his dream of becoming a writer while growing increasingly disillusioned with the dead-end world that surrounds him: an alcoholic father, a toiling mother, and the ominous specter of Nazism. Delivering a bracing jolt of kitchen-sink realism to Swedish cinema, Widerberg paints an unsparing portrait of youthful idealism bumping up against economic despair."

In adapting her own novel, Breillat unflinchingly depicts the dark desires of Alice (Charlotte Alexandra), a rural adolescent whose uninhibited sexual experimentation troubles her parents (Rita Maiden and Bruno Balp) and augurs doom for her first lover (Hiram Keller). Originally withheld from theaters due to censorship concerns, GIRL proved itself to be not only ahead of its time but also an audacious trial run for Breillat’s core strategies and themes, including the connection between transgressive fantasy and sober reality."

Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1960s panoramas of contemporary alienation were decade-defining artistic events, and RED DESERT, his first color film, is perhaps his most epochal. This provocative look at the spiritual desolation of the technological age—about a disaffected woman, brilliantly portrayed by Antonioni muse Monica Vitti, wandering through a bleak industrial landscape beset by power plants and environmental toxins, and tentatively flirting with her husband’s coworker, played by Richard Harris—continues to keep viewers spellbound. With one startling, painterly composition after another—of abandoned fishing cottages, electrical towers, looming docked ships—RED DESERT creates a nearly apocalyptic image of its time, and confirms Antonioni as cinema’s preeminent poet of the modern age."

A singular coming together of talents, REDES, commissioned by a progressive Mexican government, was cowritten and gorgeously shot by the legendary photographer Paul Strand.

A multilayered, self-reflexive portrait of a 1970s New York City feminist collective, the film charts the rifts that form within the group and between its members and the filmmaker—a breakdown that is reflected in the film’s radical splintering of sound and image.

What begins as a resurrection of the instrument evolves into an intimate and deeply personal journey—one that unexpectedly forges a profound connection with the father she never knew. Featuring appearances from Peter Gabriel, Fred Armisen, Mark Ronson, Grace Potter, and more, this heartfelt documentary is both a touching family portrait and a captivating deep dive into a nearly forgotten chapter of synth history."

Captain Hugh &#39;Bulldog&#39; Drummond, a former British officer in World War I, grows bored with civilian life and decides to become a private investigator.

This time, Drummond leads a black-shirted platoon of men from his former unit against foreign interlopers trying to pull England into dangerous overseas entanglements."

Thirty years after the original Godzilla and nine years after the final Showa-era film, the King of the Monsters was resurrected with this impressive reboot, which successfully inaugurated a new era in the franchise’s history. Ignoring the storyline established across the Showa-era films except for the first one, THE RETURN OF GODZILLA reestablished the iconic kaiju as a force of fierce destruction, while updating the film’s sociopolitical commentary for the late Cold War era. Here, the radioactive reptile returns to wreak destruction on Japan and along the way inflames tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, threatening to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war."

One of Youssef Chahine’s most daring works (both thematically and formally), this shattering allegorical musical drama charts the shockwaves that ripple through a family when the youngest son—a formerly idealistic political activist—returns from prison a changed man, now unable to stand up to his older brother’s tyranny. Scripted and scored by the influential poet Salah Jahin, RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL SON uses the framework of the biblical tale to comment provocatively on the fading of Arab unity and the shattered dreams of a grandstanding Arab republic, while simultaneously subverting and reinventing the Arab musical."

A gripping thriller and a tragic drama of nearly Greek proportions, REVANCHE is the stunning, Oscar-nominated international breakthrough of Austrian filmmaker Götz Spielmann. In a ragged section of Vienna, hardened ex-con Alex (the mesmerizing Johannes Krisch) works in a brothel, where he falls for Ukrainian hooker Tamara. Their desperate plans for escape unexpectedly intersect with the lives of a rural cop and his seemingly content wife. With meticulous, elegant direction, Spielmann creates a tense, existential, and surprising portrait of vengeance and redemption, and a journey into the darkest forest of human nature, in which violence and beauty exist side by side."

A child is raised in Korea to avenge the death of his father’s first child in this decades-spanning tale of obsession and violence, the third collaboration between director Ermek Shinarbaev and writer Anatoli Kim. A study of everyday evil infused with philosophy and poetry, this haunting allegory was the first Soviet film to look at the Korean diaspora in central Asia, and a founding work of the Kazakh New Wave. Rigorous and complex, REVENGE weaves luminous imagery with inventive narrative elements in an unforgettable meditation on the way trauma is passed down through generations.

Making explicit Pasolini’s themes of persecution and sacrifice while introducing an overtly political message, LA RICOTTA also reflects a shift from neorealism toward a more symbolic and visionary style in his filmmaking. It got him sentenced to several months in prison for contempt of religion, although the charge was reversed."

A group of teenage friends are found dead, their bodies grotesquely contorted, their faces twisted in terror. Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a journalist and the aunt of one of the victims, sets out to investigate the shocking phenomenon, and in the process uncovers a creepy urban legend about a supposedly cursed videotape, the contents of which cause anyone who views it to die within a week—unless they can persuade someone else to watch it, and, in so doing, pass on the curse."

His take on the story—in which the eponymous shipwreck survivor (an Oscar-nominated Dan O’Herlihy) faces both physical and psychological peril while stranded for decades on a desert island—succeeds equally as a gripping adventure saga and as a subtly subversive, typically Buñuelian deconstruction of traditional notions of civilization, religion, and man’s place in the universe."

Attracted by the vast, untapped space overrun with luxuriant vegetation (and its potential for drug-addled isolation), she promptly sells all of her belongings and retreats from the world. She carves an island for herself out of the sprawling squat, where she is free to grow cabbage and express herself in any way she pleases—only interrupted by the occasional intrusion from her lover, left behind in civilization, and a mysteriously antagonistic pig-tailed girl who seems to live in the landscape. Lensed by frequent Jim Jarmusch collaborator Tom DiCillo, Masashi Yamamoto’s anticapitalist punk statement is a radical vision of a multicultural, marginal Tokyo, far removed from the dominant, consumerist image of the city during the bustling era of Japan’s economic bubble."

Jealousy mounts, blood is shed, and a striving family faces self-destruction in this incisive, sensuous, emotionally bruising masterwork from director Luchino Visconti. With an operatic Nino Rota score and Giuseppe Rotunno’s glimmering, on-location cinematography, ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS “represents the artistic apotheosis of Italian neorealism,” says A.O.

Though told with more melodramatic flair than the films that would follow it to form The War Trilogy and starring some well-known actors—Aldo Fabrizi as a priest helping the partisan cause and Anna Magnani in her breakthrough role as the fiancée of a resistance member—ROME OPEN CITY is a shockingly authentic experience, conceived and directed amid the ruin of World War II, with immediacy in every frame. Marking a watershed moment in Italian cinema, this galvanic work garnered awards around the globe and left the beginnings of a new film movement in its wake."

“Is cinema a language about to get lost, an art about to die?” At the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, Wim Wenders invited fifteen other filmmakers to give their personal answers to that question. Their responses—recorded privately via a static camera inside a hotel room—form an enlightening, provocative, and philosophical reflection on the challenges then facing filmmakers and on the possible future of their industry. Featuring luminaries such as Jean-Luc Godard, Werner Herzog, Steven Spielberg, Michelangelo Antonioni, Susan Seidelman, Yılmaz Güney, and, in his last interview before his death just weeks later, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, ROOM 666 offers a uniquely candid look at the relationship between artists and their craft."

Utilizing the same minimalist, fixed camera format as Wenders, Playoust invites thirty directors who attended the 2022 festival—including Claire Denis, David Cronenberg, Lynne Ramsay, Asghar Farhadi, James Gray, and Wenders himself—to give their unfiltered perspectives on the state of the industry.

Merchant Ivory Productions, led by director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant, became a household name with A ROOM WITH A VIEW, the first of their extraordinary adaptations of E. M. Forster novels. A cherubic nineteen-year-old Helena Bonham Carter plays Lucy Honeychurch, a young, independent-minded, upper-class Edwardian woman who is trying to sort out her burgeoning romantic feelings, divided between an enigmatic free spirit (Julian Sands) she meets on vacation in Florence and the priggish bookworm (Daniel Day-Lewis) to whom she becomes engaged back in the more corseted Surrey.

ROSA LUXEMBURG is Margarethe von Trotta’s remarkable look at one of the most fascinating figures in modern European political history. Having fought for women’s rights in early-twentieth-century Poland and Germany, the Marxist revolutionary Luxemburg formed the famous Spartacist League, later the Communist Party of Germany, before being assassinated at age forty-seven. Built around an extraordinary performance from Barbara Sukowa (winner of the best actress award at Cannes), this multilayered portrait traces Luxemburg’s political and moral development from journalist and author to dissenter from the party line and imprisoned pacifist, bringing her character alive on-screen with depth and complexity."

Cantopop superstars Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung display the androgynous magnetism that made them icons as doomed lovers in this emblematic film of Hong Kong’s Second New Wave, directed by pioneering queer melodrama master Stanley Kwan. ROUGE bridges past and present in its tragic romance between a humble courtesan and the wayward scion of a wealthy family, who embrace death by suicide pact amid the opulent teahouses of 1930s Hong Kong. Fifty years later, she returns to the city-state to find him, drawing a young contemporary couple (Alex Man and Emily Chu) into her quest to rekindle a passion that may be as illusory as time itself.

A celebration of an artist’s life in the purest sense, RYUICHI SAKAMOTO | OPUS is the swan song of one of the world’s greatest musicians. As a parting gift, in late 2022, Ryuichi Sakamoto mustered all of his energy to leave us with one final performance: a concert film featuring just him and his piano. Curated and sequenced by Sakamoto himself, the twenty pieces of his played in the film wordlessly tell the story of his life and his wide-ranging oeuvre. The selection spans his entire career, from his pop-star period with Yellow Magic Orchestra and his magnificent scores for filmmakers Bernardo Bertolucci and Nagisa Oshima to his meditative final album, “12.” Intimately filmed in black and white, and surrounded by trusted collaborators—including director Neo Sora, his son—Sakamoto bares his soul through his exquisitely haunting melodies, knowing this was the last time he would be able to present his art.

“A gift from a master . . . An intensely moving experience.”
—Alissa Wilkinson, “The New York Times” (Critic’s Pick)

“To call RYUICHI SAKAMOTO | OPUS a concert film would be correct and also drastically inadequate . . . A testament to the artistic spirit and, above all, an act of love.”
—Sheri Linden, “The Hollywood Reporter”
 
“A spare, lovely work . . . The culmination of a lifelong journey.”
—Bilge Ebiri, “New York Magazine”"

Starring Sylvia Sidney, Oskar Homolka, John Loder

This loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novel “The Secret Agent” is one of the high-water marks of Alfred Hitchcock’s early British period. Sylvia Sidney is the unsuspecting wife of a London cinema owner (Oskar Homolka) whom a Scotland Yard detective (John Loder) comes to believe is behind a string of terrorist attacks. The gripping centerpiece—involving a boy, a film canister, and a ticking time bomb—stands as one of the most heart-stopping moments of pure suspense in all of Hitchcock."

While the same incident famously inspired Nagisa Oshima’s controversial IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES, Obayashi’s typically offbeat, visually remarkable telling of the story differs greatly, focusing on the title character’s backstory and adopting an often darkly humorous tone."

The comic genius of silent star Harold Lloyd is eternal. Chaplin is the sweet innocent, Keaton the stoic outsider, but Lloyd—the modern guy striving for success—is us. And with its torrent of perfectly executed gags and astonishing stunts, SAFETY LAST! is the perfect introduction to him. Lloyd plays a small-town bumpkin trying to make it in the big city, who finds employment as a lowly department-store clerk. He comes up with a wild publicity stunt to draw attention to the store, resulting in an incredible feat of derring-do on his part that gets him started on the climb to success. Laugh-out-loud funny and jaw-dropping in equal measure, SAFETY LAST! is a movie experience par excellence, anchored by a genuine legend."

Conceived as an ode to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, this titanic super spectacle, set in the twelfth-century Crusades, is Egyptian cinema’s rebuttal to the Hollywood Christian epic. Ahmed Mazhar—a military-academy classmate of Nasser’s—stars as Saladin, the ruler of the kingdoms surrounding Jerusalem. When Christian invaders slaughter a band of Muslim pilgrims, Saladin sets out to take back the holy land against all odds. Working with an unprecedented budget (so big, in fact, that it bankrupted the producer) and a cast of thousands, director Youssef Chahine’s most large-scale work is a rousing vision of pan-Arab unity realized with the director’s trademark visual dynamism."

This radically influential portrait of American dreams and disillusionment from Direct Cinema pioneers David Maysles, Albert Maysles, and Charlotte Zwerin captures, with indelible humanity, the worlds of four dogged door-to-door Bible salesmen as they travel from Boston to Florida on a seemingly futile quest to sell luxury editions of the Good Book to working-class Catholics. A vivid evocation of midcentury malaise that unfolds against a backdrop of cheap motels, smoky diners, and suburban living rooms, SALESMAN assumes poignant dimensions as it uncovers the way its subjects’ fast-talking bravado masks frustration, disappointment, and despair. Revolutionizing the art of nonfiction storytelling with its nonjudgmental, observational style, this landmark documentary is one of the most penetrating films ever made about how deeply embedded consumerism is in America’s sense of its own values."

Twists of fate, however, turn him into a fugitive. But he is saved by a woman who loves him and a cunning priest who guides him to the samurai path.

Starring Jean-Pierre Léaud, Gérard Zimmermann, Henri Martinez

In this early narrative short by Jean Eustache, French New Wave icon Jean-Pierre Léaud stars as Daniel, a ne’er-do-well who loafs around Paris with his friends in search of easy money and pretty women. Daniel believes a new job playing a street-greeting Santa Claus will provide him with golden opportunities to meet girls, but his own desperation continually stands in the way of success. By turns comic and melancholy, and filmed with Eustache’s signature black-and-white, documentary-style cinematography, SANTA CLAUS HAS BLUE EYES marks an important stepping stone among the director’s unsentimental explorations of awkward young men who avoid self-reflection in their pursuit of the opposite sex."

A beautiful female college student is found dead in a public park; the police soon discover that her murder may have been racially motivated. Basil Dearden&#39;s bold, direct police procedural, starring Nigel Patrick as the detective in charge of the investigation, is a devastating look at the way bigotry crosses class divides, and a snapshot of the increasingly interracial culture of England in the late fifties."

Masahiro Shinoda&#39;s interest in sports and experience as an athlete, he was a long-distance runner, made him an ideal choice to direct the official film of the XI Olympic Winter Games Sapporo 1972. His work is marked by its gravitas, and this can be felt in the opening Torch Relay sequence. Few Olympic films can boast such aesthetically pleasing images as this one. Shinoda takes full advan- tage of the &#39;Scope format, and of the superb equipment at his disposal. Allied to this is a subtle use of sound and silence, filtering out all extraneous noise when required."

The latest from acclaimed director Lou Ye—one of contemporary Chinese cinema’s boldest auteurs—is a stylish, spellbinding thriller built around a tour-de-force performance from the great Gong Li. It’s 1941, and China has become a wartime intelligence battlefield. Actor Jean Yu (Gong) returns to Shanghai, ostensibly to appear in the play “Saturday Fiction,” directed by her former lover. But what is her true aim? To free her ex-husband? To gather intelligence for the Allied forces? To work for her adoptive father? Or to escape from war with her lover? As she embarks on her mission, with friends ever more difficult to distinguish from undercover agents, Jean Yu starts to question whether to reveal what she has learned about the imminent Pearl Harbor attack."

Starring Albert Finney, Shirley Anne Field, Rachel Roberts

Adapted by Alan Sillitoe from his own influential debut novel, this quintessential kitchen-sink drama was one of the first films to give voice to the discontent of Britain’s working class. Arthur Seaton (Albert Finney in his breakthrough performance) is a twenty-two-year-old factory worker in Nottingham, a sprawling industrial city in the British Midlands. All week long he works hard at his lathe, asking and expecting nothing more than his weekly pay; but on Saturday evenings he asserts his independence by losing himself in drinking, brawling, and womanizing. When Brenda (Rachel Roberts), the wife of a coworker, becomes pregnant by Arthur, he begins to face the consequence of his reckless, devil-may-care ways."

The story of the charged relationship between a turn-of-the-twentieth-century circus owner (Åke Grönberg) and his younger mistress (Harriet Andersson), a horseback rider in the traveling show, the film features dreamlike detours and twisted psychosexual power plays, making for a piercingly brilliant depiction of physical and spiritual degradation."

Leslie Howard steps into the foppish finery of the seemingly ineffectual English aristocrat who, as his quick-thinking alter ego the Scarlet Pimpernel, rescues innocents from the guillotine during the French Revolution.

Sequestered in his home, a disgraced President Richard Milhous Nixon arms himself with a bottle of scotch and a gun to record memoirs that no one will hear. He is surrounded by the silent portraits of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Kissinger, and his mother, as he resurrects his past in a passionate attempt to defend himself and his political legacy. Based on the original play by Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone, and starring Philip Baker Hall in a tour de force solo performance, Robert Altman’s SECRET HONOR is a searing interrogation of the Nixon mystique and an audacious depiction of unchecked paranoia."

Made over the course of ten years, this epic work of activist cinema joins the citizens of Sennan, Osaka, as they embark on an unprecedented uphill legal battle to receive reparations from the government for exposing their community to the deadly toxins of the city’s asbestos factories. Through wrenching interviews with the victims whose lives have been shattered by the agonizing effects of asbestosis, SENNAN ASBESTOS DISASTER paints a damning portrait of how decades of negligence exacted a devastating human toll while revealing the ways in which the tragedy is deeply entwined with issues of class and anti-Korean discrimination. It’s also a galvanizing look at the power of collective action and what happens when ordinary people take on their own government—going up against an unfeeling, often maddeningly slow-moving bureaucracy in their unceasing fight for justice."

Once again exploring her signature obsessions, Breillat uses this metafictional format to investigate the ethical responsibilities of the artist, the messy logistics of running a set, and the slippery nature of realism, as applied to one of filmmaking’s most challenging ordeals: the simulated sex scene. Culminating in one actor’s ribald high jinks with a body prosthetic and another’s breakthrough into shattering emotional territory, SEX IS COMEDY is Breillat’s heady, brilliant synthesis of the ridiculous and the sublime."

A divorcé with a six-year-old daughter who has been estranged from his father for decades, he is looking for a new perspective on life while reconsidering his failings as a father, a son, and a lover.

Costarring major Fifth Generation filmmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang (THE HORSE THIEF, THE BLUE KITE), this rich, profoundly sensitive rumination on the possibility of human connection achieves a novelistic expansiveness as it surveys the ebbs and flows of a life shaped by loss, yearning, and regret."

The relationship is put in jeopardy when Tony meets Lelia’s darker-skinned jazz singer brother, Hugh (Hugh Hurd), and discovers that her racial heritage is not what he thought it was.

Directed by Ingmar Bergman, SHAME (SKAMMEN) is at once an examination of the violent legacy of World War II and a scathing response to the escalation of the conflict in Vietnam. Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann star as musicians living in quiet retreat on a remote island farm, until the civil war that drove them from the city catches up with them there. Amid the chaos of the military struggle, vividly evoked by pyrotechnics and by cinematographer Sven Nykvist’s handheld camera work, the two are faced with impossible moral choices that tear at the fabric of their relationship. This film, which contains some of the most devastating scenes in Bergman’s oeuvre, shows the impact of war on individual lives."

SHAMPOO gives us a day in the life of George (Warren Beatty), a Beverly Hills hairdresser and lothario who runs around town on the eve of the 1968 presidential election trying to make heads or tails of his financial and romantic entanglements. His attempts to scrape together the money to open his own salon are continually sidetracked by the distractions presented by his lovers—played brilliantly by Goldie Hawn, Julie Christie, and Lee Grant (in an Oscar-winning performance). Beatty dreamed up the project, cowrote the script with Robert Towne, and enlisted Hal Ashby as director, and the resulting carousel of doomed relationships is an essential seventies farce, a sharp look back at the sexual politics and self-absorption of the preceding decade."

Nico Papatakis’s caustic political allegory—made in the wake of the 1967 Greek coup d’état that led to the establishment of a right-wing military junta—takes the form of a deliriously unhinged romantic tragedy. Beginning with the image of an exploding goat and only proceeding to get stranger from there, THE SHEPHERDS OF CALAMITY (also known as THANOS AND DESPINA) centers on the forbidden romance between a poor shepherd (George Dialegmenos) and the daughter (Olga Karlatos) of a well-off family who find their love beset by the machinations of those around them."

The family begins to unravel when the captain invites Sally to live on the ship, where she and Johannes form a tender connection. Told in flashback and inspired in part by French poetic realism, A SHIP TO INDIA marks a major evolution in Ingmar Bergman’s early filmmaking, demonstrating his gifts as a conjurer of beguiling images and a dramatist of lacerating emotions."

Shot on gauzily grimy 16 mm, this short film by Gregorio Rocha (THE LOST REELS OF PANCHO VILLA) tracks the Mierdas across a single Saturday on the eave of Easter, leading up to a raucous punk show and a euphoric flight from the cops.

Decades before the artistic triumph of neorealism and the cultural revolution of the feminist movement, director Lois Weber expressed the seeds of both in what is perhaps her greatest work: an almost documentary-like look at the everyday struggles of an ordinary young woman. Eva Meyer (sixteen-year-old Mary MacLaren, in a revelatory performance) is a poor shop girl working at a five-and-dime. Each week, Eva returns to her cold-water flat and dutifully hands over her meager earnings to her mother. But her wages barely cover the grocer’s bill and cannot provide for decent clothing. With only cardboard to patch the holes in the soles of her shoes, Eva’s life becomes harder with each rainy day and every splinter. In constant pain and with no solution in sight, the disheartened girl resorts to desperate measures."

The legendary midnight-movie sensation that firmly embedded samurai mythology within American pop-culture consciousness, this English-dubbed reedit of the first two films in the classic Japanese chanbara series LONE WOLF AND CUB is a giddily entertaining, mesmerizingly gory classic of East-meets-West grindhouse mayhem. Following the murder of his wife at the hands of an evil shogun, an avenging ronin (Tomisaburo Wakayama) roams the countryside with his young son—and the boy’s sword-shooting baby carriage—in tow, dispatching ninja assassins with steely resolve in operatically stylized flurries of hallucinatory violence. With its pulsing synth soundtrack (cowritten by Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere &amp;amp; the Raiders) and delirious action set pieces—kinetically edited whirlwinds of flashing blades, spurting blood, and severed limbs—SHOGUN ASSASSIN proved an instant cult favorite that has bubbled its way up from the underground thanks to its influence on artists ranging from the Wu-Tang Clan to Quentin Tarantino."

Two sisters—the sickly, intellectual Ester (Ingrid Thulin) and the sensual, pragmatic Anna (Gunnel Lindblom)—travel by train with Anna’s young son, Johan (Jörgen Lindström), to a foreign country that appears to be on the brink of war. Attempting to cope with their alien surroundings, each sister is left to her own vices while they vie for Johan’s affection, and in so doing sabotage what little remains of their relationship. Regarded as one of the most sexually provocative films of its day, Ingmar Bergman’s THE SILENCE offers a disturbing vision of emotional isolation in a suffocating spiritual void."

Jean-Pierre Melville began his superb feature filmmaking career with this powerful adaptation of an influential underground novel written during the Nazi occupation of France. A cultured, naively idealistic German officer is billeted in the home of a middle-aged man and his grown niece; their response to his presence—their only form of resistance—is complete silence. Constructed with elegant minimalism and shot, by the legendary Henri Decaë, with hushed eloquence, LE SILENCE DE LA MER points the way toward Melville’s later films about resistance and the occupation (LEON MORIN, PRIEST; ARMY OF SHADOWS) yet remains a singularly eerie masterwork in its own right."

Yet the devil, in the figure of the beautiful Silvia Pinal, huddles below, trying to tempt him down.

Jacques Demy, directing in his très charmant, candy-colored visual style, plays the absurdist premise for both cheery comedy and slyly subversive social commentary, raising serious questions about male-female social roles and gender equality."

After escaping New Jersey, the quintessentially punk Wren (Susan Berman)—a spark plug in fishnets—moves to the city with the mission of becoming famous. When not pasting up self-promotional flyers or hanging at the Peppermint Lounge, she’s getting involved with Paul (Brad Rinn), the nicest guy to ever live in a van next to the highway, and Eric (Richard Hell), an aloof rocker. Shot on 16 mm film that captures the grit and glam of downtown in the 1980s, with an alternately moody and frenetic soundtrack by the Feelies and others, SMITHEREENS—the first American independent film to compete for the Palme d’Or—is an unfaded snapshot of a bygone era."

Directed by Med Hondo • 1970 • France, Mauritania
Starring Robert Liensol, Théo Légitimus, Gabriel Glissand

A furious howl of resistance against racist oppression, the debut from Mauritanian director Med Hondo is a bitterly funny, stylistically explosive attack on Western capitalism and the legacy of colonialism. Laced with deadly irony and righteous anger, SOLEIL Ô follows a starry-eyed immigrant (Robert Liensol) as he leaves West Africa and journeys to Paris in search of a job and cultural enrichment—but soon discovers a hostile society in which his very presence elicits fear and resentment. Drawing on the freewheeling stylistic experimentation of the French New Wave, Hondo deploys a dizzying array of narrative and stylistic techniques—animation, docudrama, dream sequences, musical numbers, folklore, slapstick comedy, agitprop—to create a revolutionary landmark of political cinema and a shattering vision of awakening black consciousness.

SOLEIL Ô was restored as part of the African Film Heritage Project, an initiative created by The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project, the Pan-African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), and UNESCO, in collaboration with the Cineteca di Bologna, to help locate, restore, and disseminate fifty African films with historic, artistic, and cultural significance. Restoration funding was provided by the George Lucas Family Foundation and The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project."

“ . . . people who move away from the gender they were assigned at birth [. . .] want to strike out toward some new location, some space not yet clearly defined or concretely occupied; [. . .] the movement across a socially imposed boundary away from an unchosen starting place.” —Susan Stryker, “Transgender History”

Somewhere a Destination

There are changes that I’m happy about, small ones that only I notice. The details on my skin or every new centimeter of hair, I watch them crawl like a trail of ants on the wall from an undecipherable nook of somewhere else. Sometimes I would hear whispers from my thighs and a humming by my arms, which come so unexpectedly like a breeze, the one that comes in on a busy street of a working afternoon. From a distance and without pausing, they may only seem to be a wall or just a busy street, but it still makes a body—even if it’s just one and only mine.

                                    “It can only be so rewarding,” I tell people whenever I’m asked how it feels to be in this body.

What other people notice is a collection of these changes in images. Ones they collect of a body from 2017 versus the images they have of it today. They recognize an image and assume that that is a certain destination of a body, while only so few can come close and maybe even pause to see that these images are moving, transitioning in perpetuity. Ambiguous details of an ambiguous destination.

I look up at the sky, it’s nighttime. On the left is one grey cloud and it stays there. I look straight at the tall buildings, all staying still. Some windows beam out a light, some are just about to be turned off. If I were by the sea, looking straight wouldn’t mean looking at stiff structures, but the sea, instead, of course. And it would curl in on itself, releasing to the shore. I imagine being there, knowing how much I miss its promise of always new images. I look to the skies again, the one that pairs with the buildings, and the cloud is on the middle. If it were 2pm, I would be hearing metal and wood from a construction nearby. There just always is one and it didn’t matter if it was in my line of sight or someplace else, something was always being built here. The one I am seeing now may promise new images; seeing new details added by its construction. But it has to be finished one day, and the changes it is meant to take would be final. New details would be decay, until its fixed to another defined image. And I watch the cloud. Slowly changing its position, moving closer to the right. It expands too, a new shape, a new thing anyone could imagine it to be. Moments ago, I was imagining the cloud as a person in a dress swaying, perhaps they were dancing. Now I’m imagining a wrist that softly points its hand somewhere. From where I sit looking on, only half of this horizon promises ambiguity, hopefully in perpetuity.

There can be glimpses of what feels rewarding. A recognition that something feels right, finally, brings this reward. When a body looks around a space and notices all the wrong things about it, in its rigidness and straight lines, a body starts to desire. This is when queerhood starts: desiring for a better place, somewhere far from present rigidness, somewhere vast and unexplored. 

And being there is like being with her, watching her get dressed and pick the right shoes to dance in. Sometimes she’d lend me her earrings or fix my hair before we head out. Being there feels like laughing with them while walking in a dark street. It feels dangerous, that in any moment uniformed men would force us to show identification and threaten us, then nothing happens. They and I continue to walk. It’s like being with him quietly looking for our seats in a movie house, sitting down and ready to watch. In this dark room, the light is on both our faces, slowly attaining inspiration. When we’re all watching a fireworks show— more light on our faces, changing in each boom and spark. Joy and astonishment. The fireworks are loud but we all cheered much louder, together. Even when one tried to catch their breath, to take a moment in, we were in chorus. 

                                    When you and I make a bed after sleeping in the afternoon. Checking all corners are tucked in tight. You offer me tea, knowing just how I like it. The sun starts to set, its orange blushes the white clouds. You say “the clouds are blushing”. You and I sit outside and watch until it’s all grey, before heading back inside for dinner. Being there is being with you.

Glimpses of somewhere, at least for now."

Six years later, while leading a seemingly normal life in Toronto with her tempestuous daughter Lucía (Natalia Aranguren), Aurora is confronted with her past in the form of her estranged cousin Edgar (Francisco Zaldua), who was a suspect in her husband’s murder, and whose appearance threatens to destroy everything she’s built."

The occasion for this landmark event was a live performance of their album “Songs for Drella,” a wry and wrenching tribute to their recently deceased former manager Andy Warhol (the nickname, Drella, a portmanteau of Dracula and Cinderella, hints at the complex feelings the two men held for the artist, who exerted a Svengali-like influence over their early careers).

This is where it all started. John Ford’s smash hit and enduring masterpiece STAGECOACH revolutionized the western, elevating it from B movie to the A-list and establishing the genre as we know it today. The quintessential tale of a group of strangers thrown together into extraordinary circumstances, STAGECOACH features outstanding performances from Hollywood stalwarts Claire Trevor, John Carradine, and Thomas Mitchell, and, of course, John Wayne, in his first starring role for Ford, as the daredevil outlaw the Ringo Kid.

When a pair of a detectives lose the trail of a murder suspect, they camp out across the street from his ex-lover (Hideko Takamine) in hopes that she will lead them to their man. It’s the beginning of an extended surveillance operation that gradually reveals as much about the woman they are watching—and the oppressive marriage she is trapped in—as the case they are investigating. Adapted by regular Kurosawa screenwriter Shinobu Hashimoto (RASHOMON, SEVEN SAMURAI) from a story by Seicho Matsumoto and directed with cool precision by noir specialist Yoshitaro Nomura, this slow-burn procedural blends a Hitchcockian study of voyeurism with an empathetic look at the circumstances of women in postwar Japan."

Andrei Tarkovsky’s final Soviet feature is a metaphys­ical journey through an enigmatic postapocalyptic landscape, and a rarefied cinematic experience like no other. A hired guide—the Stalker—leads a writer and a professor into the heart of the Zone, the restricted site of a long-ago disaster, where the three men eventually zero in on the Room, a place rumored to fulfill one’s most deeply held desires. Adapting a science-fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Tarkovsky created an immersive world with a wealth of material detail and a sense of organic atmosphere. A religious allegory, a reflection of contemporaneous political anxieties, a meditation on film itself—STALKER envelops the viewer by opening up a multitude of possible meanings."

In the sun-saturated San Fernando Valley, adult-film star Jane, a.k.a. Tess Steele (Dree Hemingway), hits the jackpot when she discovers several thousand dollars inside a thermos purchased at an elderly woman’s yard sale. After splurging on accessories and a manicure, Jane—racked by guilt—offers to assist the old widow, Sadie (Besedka Johnson), with shopping and other chores. Sensing a disruption of her comfortable solitude, Sadie tries fending off Jane’s overtures of friendship, but each gradually find in the other the loving relationship missing from their lives. As the pair’s mother-daughter bond deepens, however, Jane risks alienating her friend, roommate, and colleague Melissa (Stella Maeve). Once again focusing on those at the margins of society and capturing the details of an overlooked profession, director Sean Baker elicits revelatory performances from Hemingway (daughter of Mariel and great-granddaughter of Ernest) and the eighty-five-year-old Johnson (in her first and only screen role) for a profound, comic, and beautifully crafted story about the possibility of connection in a world of artifice and isolation."

Fast-forward to 2013, when the Dominican Republic’s Supreme Court stripped the citizenship of anyone with Haitian parents, retroactive to 1929. The ruling rendered more than 200,000 people stateless, without nationality, identity, or a homeland. In this dangerous climate, a young attorney named Rosa Iris mounts a grassroots campaign, challenging electoral corruption and advocating for social justice. In STATELESS, director Michèle Stephenson traces the complex tributaries of history and present-day politics, issuing an urgent warning about what can happen when racism runs rampant in the government."

Cowritten by Franco Solinas, the electrifying STATE OF SIEGE piercingly critiques the American government for supporting foreign dictatorships, while also asking difficult questions about the efficacy of radical violent acts to oppose such regimes."

When he conceives a child with the free-spirited shepherdess Marie (India Hair), who subsequently abandons both him and the baby, Léo suddenly finds himself alone with the daunting responsibility of raising a human being.

Fengjie’s old town has been torn down and submerged forever, but its new neighborhood hasn’t been finished yet. There are still things that need to be salvaged, and yet there are also things that must be left behind. Such life-changing choices face Sanming (Han Sanming), a miner traveling to Fengjie in search of his estranged wife, and Shen Hong (Zhao Tao), a nurse who has come to Fengjie to look for the husband she hasn’t seen in two years.

Created as a tribute to his late mother, the film depicts one day in the life of the Yokoyamas, gathered together for a commemorative ritual whose nature only gradually becomes clear. Rather than focus on big dramatic moments, Kore-eda relies on simple gestures and domestic routines (especially cooking) to evoke a family’s entire life, its deep regrets and its daily joys.

One of a string of late-career masterworks made by Kenji Mizoguchi in the first half of the 1950s, A STORY FROM CHIKAMATSU (a.k.a. THE CRUCIFIED LOVERS) is an exquisitely moving tale of forbidden love struggling to survive in the face of persecution. Based on a classic of eighteenth-century Japanese drama, the film traces the injustices that befall a Kyoto scroll maker’s wife and his apprentice after each is unfairly accused of wrongdoing. Bound by fate in an illicit, star-crossed romance, they go on the run in search of refuge from the punishment prescribed them: death. Shot in gorgeous, painterly style by master cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, this delicately delivered indictment of societal oppression was heralded by Akira Kurosawa as a “great masterpiece that could only have been made by Mizoguchi.”

Unable to break into segregated Hollywood, Van Peebles decamped to France, taught himself the language, and wrote a number of books in French, one of which, “La permission,” would become the stylistically innovative THE STORY OF A THREE DAY PASS. Turner (Harry Baird), an African American soldier stationed in France, is granted a promotion and a three-day leave from base by his casually racist commanding officer and heads to Paris, where he finds whirlwind romance with a white woman (Nicole Berger)—but what happens to their love when his furlough is over? Channeling the brash exuberance of the French New Wave, Van Peebles creates an exploration of the psychology of an interracial relationship as well as a commentary on France’s contradictory attitudes about race that is playful, sarcastic, and stingingly subversive by turns, and that laid the foundation for the scorched-earth cinematic revolution he would let loose just a few years later."

Starring Takeshi Sakamoto, Choko Iida, Koji (Hideo) Mitsui

In 1959, Yasujiro Ozu remade his 1934 silent classic A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS in color with the celebrated cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa (RASHOMON, UGETSU). Setting his later version in a seaside location, Ozu otherwise preserves the details of his elegantly simple plot wherein an aging actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his former lover and illegitimate son, a scenario that enrages his current mistress and results in heartbreak for all. Together, the films offer a unique glimpse into the evolution of one of cinema’s greatest directors. A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS reveals Ozu in the midst of developing his mode of expression; FLOATING WEEDS reveals his distinct style at its pinnacle. In each, the director captures the joy and sadness in everyday life."

This heartrending masterpiece by Kenji Mizoguchi about the give-and-take between life and art marked the first full realization of the hypnotic long takes and eloquent camera movements that would come to define the director’s films. Kikunosuke (Shotaro Hanayagi), the adopted son of a legendary kabuki actor who is striving to achieve stardom by mastering female roles, turns to his infant brother’s wet nurse for support and affection—and she soon gives up everything for her beloved’s creative glory. Offering a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes of kabuki theater in the late nineteenth century, THE STORY OF THE LAST CHRYSANTHEMUM provides a critique of the oppression of women and the sacrifices required of them, and represents the pinnacle of Mizoguchi’s early career."

Isabelle Huppert won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival for her riveting performance in this tale of wartime survival based on the true story of Marie-Louise Giraud, one of the last women to be executed by guillotine in France. Struggling to survive in Nazi-occupied France, impoverished mother Marie (Huppert) finds success and a chance at a better life by performing clandestine abortions—work that puts her in conflict with the Vichy regime’s brutal ban against the practice, which it regards as a “crime against the state.”"

With this breakthrough film, Federico Fellini launched both himself and his wife and collaborator Giulietta Masina to international stardom, breaking with the neorealism of his early career in favor of a personal, poetic vision of life as a bittersweet carnival. The infinitely expressive Masina registers both childlike wonder and heartbreaking despair as Gelsomina, loyal companion to the traveling strongman Zampanò (Anthony Quinn, in a toweringly physical performance), whose callousness and brutality gradually wear down her gentle spirit. Winner of the very first Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, LA STRADA (“The Road”) possesses the purity and timeless resonance of a fable and remains one of cinema’s most exquisitely moving visions of humanity struggling to survive in the face of life’s cruelties."

In 1945, the free world rejoiced over the defeat of fascism.

In response, boundary-pushing publisher and producer Barney Rosset and director Leo Hurwitz joined forces to create STRANGE VICTORY. This rarely seen, stylistically bold documentary equals the visual brilliance of landmark works like BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN and I AM CUBA while delivering an extraordinary cry for equality and justice. Skillfully combining real-life footage of World War II combat, postwar refugees, and the Nuremberg trials with powerful dramatic reenactments, Hurwitz weaves an extraordinary cinematic portrait of postwar American fascism. How could it be, the film asks, that servicemen returning home from defeating a racist and genocidal enemy found a United States plagued by prejudice, Jim Crow, anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and xenophobia?"

In 1937, tens of thousands of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent were exterminated by the Dominican army, the killings fueled by anti-Black hatred fomented by the Dominican government. Fast-forward to 2013, when the Dominican Republic’s Supreme Court stripped the citizenship of anyone with Haitian parents, retroactive to 1929. The ruling rendered more than 200,000 people stateless, without nationality, identity, or a homeland. In this dangerous climate, a young attorney named Rosa Iris mounts a grassroots campaign, challenging electoral corruption and advocating for social justice. In STATELESS, director Michèle Stephenson traces the complex tributaries of history and present-day politics, issuing an urgent warning about what can happen when racism runs rampant in the government."

Pierre Etaix’s first feature introduces the droll humor and oddball charm of its unique writer-director-star. As a tribute to Buster Keaton, Etaix fashioned this lovable story of a privileged yet sheltered young man (played by Etaix himself, in a nearly silent performance) who, under pressure from his parents, sets out to find a young woman to marry—though he has a hard time tearing his mind away from the famous singer whose face decorates the walls of his bedroom."

Starring Maj-Britt Nilsson, Birger Malmsten

Touching on many of the themes that would define the rest of his career—isolation, performance, the inescapability of the past— Ingmar Bergman’s tenth film was a gentle drift toward true mastery. Maj-Britt Nilsson beguiles as an accomplished ballet dancer haunted by her tragic youthful affair with a shy, handsome student (Birger Malmsten). Her memories of the sunny, rocky shores of Stockholm’s outer archipelago mingle with scenes from her gloomy present at the theater where she performs. A film that the director considered a creative turning point, SUMMER INTERLUDE is a reverie about life and death that unites Bergman’s love of theater and cinema."

With this sublimely bittersweet tale of romantic longing, director David Lean left behind the British soundstage to capture in radiant Technicolor the sun-splashed glory of Venice at the height of summer. In a tour de force of fearless vulnerability, Katharine Hepburn portrays the conflicting emotions that stir the heart of a lonely, middle-aged American tourist who is forced to confront her insecurities when she is drawn into a seemingly impossible affair with a charming Italian shopkeeper (Rossano Brazzi) amid the ancient city’s canals and piazzas. Lean’s personal favorite among his own films, SUMMERTIME is an exquisitely tender evocation of the magic and melancholy of a fleeting, not-quite-fairy-tale romance."

Inspired by the earthy eroticism of Harriet Andersson, in the first of her many roles for him, Ingmar Bergman had a major international breakthrough with this sensual and ultimately ravaging tale of young love. A girl (Andersson) and boy (Lars Ekborg) from working-class families in Stockholm run away from home to spend a secluded, romantic summer at the beach, far from parents and responsibilities. Inevitably, it is not long before the pair are forced to return to reality. The version initially released in the U.S. was reedited by its distributor into something more salacious, but the original SUMMER WITH MONIKA (SOMMAREN MED MONIKA), presented here, is a work of stunning maturity and one of Bergman’s most important films."

In the North of Spain, Estrella grows up captivated by her father, a doctor with mystical powers—and by the enigma of his youth in the South, a near-mythical region whose secrets haunt Estrella more and more as time goes on. Though Erice’s original vision also encompassed a section set in the South itself, scenes that were never shot, EL SUR remains an experience of rare perfection and satisfaction, drawing on painterly cinematography by José Luis Alcaine to evoke the enchantments of memory and the inaccessible, inescapable mysteries of the past."

With its ragged black-and-white 16 mm photography and strong sense of 1960s Paris, SUZANNE’S CAREER, the second of Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales, is a wonderfully evocative portrait of youthful naivete and the complicated bonds of friendship and romance."

A landmark of Black and American independent cinema that would send shock waves through the culture, SWEET SWEETBACK’S BAADASSSSS SONG was Melvin Van Peebles’s second feature film, after he walked away from a contract with Columbia in order to make his next film on his own terms. Acting as producer, director, writer, composer, editor, and star, Van Peebles created the prototype for what Hollywood would eventually co-opt and make into the blaxploitation hero: a taciturn, perpetually blank-faced performer in a sex show, who, when he’s pushed too far by a pair of racist cops looking to frame him for a crime he didn’t commit, goes on the run through a lawless underground of bikers, revolutionaries, sex workers, and hippies in a kill-or-be-killed quest for liberation from white oppression. SWEET SWEETBACK’S BAADASSSSS SONG’s incendiary politics are matched by Van Peebles’s revolutionary style, in which jagged jump cuts, kaleidoscopic superimpositions, and psychedelic sound design come together in a sustained howl of rage and defiance.

With this film, conceived during the occupation and released after the war, Claude Autant-Lara entered the realm of pure fantasy. Odette Joyeux stars as Sylvie, in love with a figure from the lore of her family&#39;s castle. Sylvie&#39;s father hires three actors to impersonate the ghost of her beloved, while the spirit himself (Jacques Tati, in his first feature-film role) stalks the grounds. Marrying a playful script, artful special effects, and wistful performances, Sylvie et le fantôme stages a delicate dance of enchantment."

Starring William Greaves, Patricia Ree Gilbert, Don Fellows

In his one-of-a-kind fiction/documentary hybrid SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: TAKE ONE, the pioneering William Greaves presides over a beleaguered film crew in New York’s Central Park, leaving them to try to figure out what kind of movie they’re making. A couple enacts a breakup scenario over and over, a documentary crew films a crew filming the crew, locals wander casually into the frame: the project defies easy description. Yet this wildly innovative sixties counterculture landmark remains one of the most tightly focused and insightful movies ever made about making movies, expanded thirty-five years later by its unconventional follow-up, SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: TAKE 2½. The “sequel” sees TAKE ONE actors Audrey Henningham and Shannon Baker reunited in a more personal, metatheatrical exploration of the effects of the passage of time on technology, the artistic process, and relationships—real and fabricated."

Directed by Edward Yang • 1985 • Taiwan
Starring Hou Hsiao-hsien, Tsai Chin

Edward Yang’s second feature is a mournful anatomy of a city caught between the past and the present. Made in collaboration with Yang&#39;s fellow New Taiwan Cinema master Hou Hsiao-hsien, TAIPEI STORY chronicles the growing estrangement between a washed-up baseball player (Hou, in a rare on-screen performance) working in his family’s textile business and his girlfriend (Tsai Chin), who clings to the upward mobility of her career in property development. As the couple&#39;s dreams of marriage and emigration begin to unravel, Yang’s gaze illuminates the precariousness of domestic life and the desperation of Taiwan’s globalized modernity.

The American dream has rarely seemed so far away as in Sean Baker and Shih-Ching Tsou’s raw, vérité TAKE OUT, an immersion in the life of an undocumented Chinese immigrant struggling to get by on the margins of post-9/11 New York City. Facing violent retaliation from a loan shark, restaurant deliveryman Ming Ding has until nightfall to pay back the money he owes, and he encounters both crushing setbacks and moments of unexpected humanity as he races against time to earn enough in tips over the course of a frantic day. From this simple setup, Baker and Tsou fashion a kind of neorealist survival thriller of the everyday, shedding compassionate light on the too often overlooked lives and labor that keep New York running."

Filmmaking legend Roberto Rossellini brings his passion for realism and unerring eye for the everyday to this portrait of the early years of the reign of France’s “Sun King,” and in the process reinvents the costume drama. The death of chief minister Cardinal Mazarin, the construction of the palace at Versailles, the extravagant meals of the royal court: all are recounted with the same meticulous quotidian detail that Rossellini brought to his contemporary portraits of postwar Italy. THE TAKING OF POWER BY LOUIS XIV dares to place a larger-than-life figure at the level of mere mortal."

The concluding installment of the Tales of the Four Seasons tetralogy is a breezy take on the classic American romantic comedies that influenced Eric Rohmer and his New Wave peers. Set in the Rhône Valley and taking full advantage of its golden vineyards, A TALE OF AUTUMN concerns simultaneous schemes to find a new love for reserved winegrower and widow Magali (Béatrice Romand). While Magali’s son’s girlfriend (Alexia Portal) attempts to pair her with a former professor and lover (Didier Sandre), Magali’s friend Isabelle (Marie Rivière) assumes a false identity in order to lure eligible bachelor Gérald (Alain Libolt). The misunderstandings that follow are pure Rohmer in revealing the humor of human folly and foibles."

In the first film of Tales of the Four Seasons, a burgeoning friendship between philosophy teacher Jeanne (Anne Teyssèdre) and pianist Natacha (Florence Darel) is strained by jealousy, suspicion, and intrigue. Natacha encourages Jeanne to pursue the former’s father, Igor (Hugues Quester), in order to supplant Eve (Eloïse Bennett), the young girlfriend Natacha loathes. Natacha’s scheme, however, risks alienating those closest to her as well as entangling Jeanne in a romantic drama she has vowed to avoid. A TALE OF SPRINGTIME demonstrates Rohmer in full command of subtle visual storytelling as he contrasts the brightness of his characters’ Parisian and suburban surroundings with their conflicting desires, ideas, and temperaments."

According to Eric Rohmer, the third film of Tales of the Four Seasons is his “most personal vehicle.” Based on events from Rohmer’s youth, A TALE OF SUMMER follows amateur musician Gaspard (Melvil Poupaud) to a seaside resort in Dinard, on the coast of Brittany. There, each of three women (Amanda Langlet, Gwenaëlle Simon, and Aurelia Nolin) offers the possibility of romance, but Gaspard’s inability to commit to just one puts all of his chances at love in jeopardy. SUMMER features Rohmer’s wistful observations on indecisiveness and the fickle nature of desire, as brought to life by a talented young cast in a picturesque setting."

As tensions mount between rival yakuza clans, one boss hires a formidable but ailing ronin as his clan’s muscle, while the other employs a humble, moral blind masseur named Ichi. With its lightning-fast swordplay, sleight-of-hand dice games, and codes of honor upheld and betrayed, this first chapter sets the stage for all the ZATOICHI adventures to come.

The tale of an eccentric band of culinary ronin who guide the widow of a noodle-shop owner on her quest for the perfect recipe, this rapturous “ramen western” by Japanese director Juzo Itami is an entertaining, genre-bending adventure underpinned by a deft satire of the way social conventions distort the most natural of human urges, our appetites. Interspersing the efforts of Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto) and friends to make her café a success with the erotic exploits of a gastronome gangster and glimpses of food culture both high and low, the sweet, sexy, and surreal TAMPOPO is a lavishly inclusive paean to the sensual joys of nourishment, and one of the most mouthwatering examples of food on film ever made."

In 1988, renegade filmmaker Robert Altman and Pulitzer Prize-winning Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau created a presidential candidate, ran him alongside the other hopefuls during the primary season, and presented their media campaign as a cross between a soap opera and TV news. In this episode, Tanner&#39;s wedding plans are deflated and his campaign prospects dwindle."

Starring Homayoun Ershadi, Abdolrahman Bagheri, Afshin Khorshid Bakhtiari

The first Iranian film to win the Palme d’Or, this austere, emotionally complex drama by the great Abbas Kiarostami follows the middle-aged Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) as he drives around the hilly outskirts of Tehran looking for someone who will agree to dispose of his body after he commits suicide, a taboo under Islam. Extended conversations with three passengers (a soldier, a seminarian, and a taxidermist) elicit different views of mortality and individual choice. Operating at once as a closely observed, realistic story and a fable populated by archetypal figures, TASTE OF CHERRY challenges the viewer to consider what often goes unexamined in everyday life."

Starring Rita Tushingham, Murray Melvin, Paul Danquah

The revolutionary British New Wave films of the early 1960s were celebrated for their uncompromising depictions of working-class lives and relations between the sexes. Directed by Tony Richardson, a leading light of that movement, and based on one of the most controversial plays of its time, A TASTE OF HONEY stars Rita Tushingham, in a star-making debut role, as a disaffected teenager finding her way amid the economic desperation of industrial Manchester, and despite an absent, self-absorbed mother. With its unapologetic identification with social outcasts and its sensitive, modern approach to matters of sexuality and race, Richardson&#39;s classic is a still startling benchmark work of realism."

Certainly the most exuberantly entertaining film ever made about the intricacies of the Japanese tax system, this delightful comedy stars Nobuko Miyamoto as a fiercely dedicated tax collector who goes to elaborate lengths to nab a tax-evading hood (Tsutomu Yamazaki) operating a string of adult motels. Director Juzo Itami stages the ensuing battle of wills with breathless verve (and a dash of sex) while cleverly critiquing capitalist greed.

Nobuko Miyamoto returns to the role of Ryoko Itakura, the tough-as-nails government tax investigator whom you most definitely don’t want to cross, in Juzo Itami’s energetic, genre-twisting follow-up to A TAXING WOMAN. Slightly darker in tone than the more comedic original, this outing finds the tenacious Ryoko deploying her skills in order to expose a fanatical religious cult lead by a corrupt sociopath (Rentaro Mikuni) concealing billions in illegal funds."

Starring Terence Stamp, Silvana Mangano, Massimo Girotti

One of the iconoclastic Pier Paolo Pasolini’s most radical provocations finds the auteur moving beyond the poetic, proletarian earthiness that first won him renown and notoriety with a coolly cryptic exploration of bourgeois spiritual emptiness. Terence Stamp stars as the mysterious stranger—perhaps an angel, perhaps a devil—who, one by one, seduces the members of a wealthy Milanese family (including European cinema icons Silvana Mangano, Massimo Girotti, Laura Betti, and Anne Wiazemsky), precipitating an existential crisis in each of their lives. Unfolding nearly wordlessly in a procession of sacred and profane images, this tantalizing metaphysical riddle—blocked from exhibition by the Catholic Church for degeneracy—is at once a blistering Marxist treatise on sex, religion, and art and a primal scream into the void."

Unfolding in nine incisive vignettes, this elegantly minimalist, powerfully subversive portrait of the everyday absurdity of life under authoritarianism follows an array of Iranians as they navigate the cultural, religious, and institutional constraints imposed on them by various social authorities, from schoolteachers to bureaucrats. These stirring snapshots—by turns humorous, affecting, Kafkaesque, and tragic—capture the spirit and determination of ordinary people in the face of adversity, offering a provocative, nuanced perspective on a complex society."

In Godzilla’s last gasp of the Showa era, aliens retrieve Mechagodzilla’s remains and rebuild it with the aid of an unhinged biologist (a scenery-chewing Akihiko Hirata), in hopes of defeating Godzilla for possession of planet Earth. This film marked the return of director Ishiro Honda, who had retired years earlier, disheartened by the increasingly kid-friendly approach of the series. For this final entry, Honda steers the King of the Monsters back into grim territory, interweaving an alien-invasion plot with a tale of tragic romance."

Starring Nastassja Kinski, Peter Firth, Leigh Lawson

This multiple-Oscar-winning film by Roman Polanski is an exquisite, richly layered adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s “Tess of the d’Urbervilles.” A strong-willed peasant girl (Nastassja Kinski, in a gorgeous breakthrough) is sent by her father to the estate of some local aristocrats to capitalize on a rumor that their families are from the same line. This fateful visit commences an epic narrative of sex, class, betrayal, and revenge, which Polanski unfolds with deliberation and finesse. With its earthy visual textures, achieved by two world-class cinematographers—Geoffrey Unsworth (CABARET) and Ghislain Cloquet (AU HASARD BALTHAZAR)—TESS is a work of great pastoral beauty as well as vivid storytelling."

Starring Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Otto Wernicke, Oskar Beregi, Sr.

Locked away in an asylum for a decade and teetering between life and death, the criminal mastermind Doctor Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) has scribbled his last will and testament: a manifesto establishing a future empire of crime. When the document’s nefarious writings start leading to terrifying parallels in reality, it’s up to Berlin’s star detective, Inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke, reprising his role from M) to connect the most fragmented, maddening clues in a case unlike any other. A sequel to his enormously successful silent film DR. MABUSE: THE GAMBLER, Fritz Lang’s THE TESTAMENT OF DR. MABUSE reunites the director with the character that had effectively launched his career. Lang put slogans and ideas expounded by the Nazis into the mouth of a madman, warning his audience of an imminent menace, which was soon to become a reality. Nazi Minister of Information Joseph Goebbels saw the film as an instruction manual for terrorist action against the government and banned it for “endangering public order and security.” A landmark of mystery and suspense for countless espionage and noir thrillers to come, this is the complete, uncut original director’s version in a stunning new transfer."

In a mysterious wasteland, he meets several symbolic phantoms that bring about his death and resurrection. With an eclectic cast that includes Pablo Picasso, Jean-Pierre Leáud, Jean Marais, and Yul Brynner, TESTAMENT OF ORPHEUS brings full circle the journey Cocteau began in THE BLOOD OF A POET, an exploration of the torturous relationship between the artist and his creations."

Julien Duvivier’s meticulously crafted adaptation of a novel by legendary crime writer Georges Simenon stars Harry Baur as the author’s most indelible creation, Inspector Jules Maigret, who here investigates the odd circumstances surrounding the killing of a wealthy American woman in Paris—a mystery that draws him into the seedy underworld of 1930s France. Every bit Baur’s equal is the Russian émigré actor Valéry Inkijinoff, who delivers a diabolically disturbing performance as a reptilian, nihilistic medical student. Working in a high-expressionistic, proto-noir style, Duvivier fills LA TÊTE D’UN HOMME (“A Man’s Head”) with one evocative image after another, constructing a work of sinister beauty and stark psychological intensity."

An ordinary Japanese salaryman undergoes a shocking metamorphosis in Shinya Tsukamoto’s legendary fusion of body horror and cyberpunk expressionism. A strange man known only as the “metal fetishist” (played by the director)—who is driven by an insane compulsion to pierce his body with scrap metal—is hit and possibly killed by an office worker (Tomoro Taguchi) out for a drive with his girlfriend (Kei Fujiwara). Soon, the salaryman realizes that he is being overtaken by some kind of disease that is turning his body into scrap metal, and that his nemesis is not in fact dead but is somehow masterminding his rage and frustration-fueled transformation."

A lost-and-found revelation from indie film and TV maverick Jan Oxenberg is a docu-fantasy narrative focused on the filmmaker’s hilarious, messy, Jewish family as they prepare to say goodbye to someone they love. Narrated by a cardboard cutout of Oxenberg’s scowling child self, THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT takes us on a journey through the proceedings, attempting to defeat death and never say goodbye. An early Sundance hit but virtually unseen for decades, the film reemerges as a singular, uncategorizable exploration of the meaning of life, death, and the tangled stuff that is a family. In this poignant, hilarious, and complex reflection on letting go, Oxenberg innovatively transforms personal tragedy into universally resonant art that is now claiming its rightful place as a classic of independent cinema."

Yasujiro Ozu’s frequent leading man Chishu Ryu is riveting as Shuhei, a widowed high school teacher who finds that the more he tries to do what is best for his son’s future, the more they are separated. Though primarily a delicately wrought story of parental love, THERE WAS A FATHER offers themes of sacrifice that were deemed appropriately patriotic by Japanese censors at the time of its release during World War II, making it a uniquely political film in Ozu’s body of work."

Hiding out in China’s densely populated (and deeply divided) Wuhan province, Zhou becomes entangled with a beautiful, enigmatic woman, who has mysterious intentions of her own. Featuring gorgeous, neon-drenched cinematography and bursts of shocking, expertly choreographed action, this spellbinding neonoir is a bracing plunge into the darkest margins of contemporary Chinese society."

Incorporating stylized reenactments, penetrating interviews, and haunting original music by Philip Glass, Morris uses cinema to build a case forensically while effortlessly entertaining his viewers.

Skipping through time, THINGS TO COME bears witness to world war, disease, dictatorship, and, finally, utopia.

Based on a novel by leftist author Norio Nanjo, THE THIRD SHADOW WARRIOR weaves the twisty tale of Kyonosuke Ninomiya (Raizo Ichikawa), a young peasant whose dreams of becoming a samurai seemingly come true when he is recruited to serve as a lookalike decoy for a merciless warlord.

Taking a hip-shaking stroll from New Orleans to Appalachia, filmmakers Chris Simon and Maureen Gosling come face-to-face with the creators of indigenous music, including King of Zydeco Clifton Chenier, fiddler Michael Doucet, Norteño great Flaco Jiménez, and Cajun outfit the Pine Leaf Boys.

With a poet’s eye for place, light, and the spiritual dimensions of everyday existence, Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese crafts a meditation on the concept of homeland and a transcendent elegy for what is lost in the name of progress. Grieving and alone following the deaths of her husband and children, elderly Mantoa (Mary Twala Mhlongo, in a soul-shaking end-of-life performance) prepares for her own death and to be buried alongside her ancestors. When plans for a new dam near her village in the landlocked kingdom of Lesotho threaten to literally wash away all she holds dear, Mantoa takes a last stand, mobilizing her neighbors to fight for their land and their way of life. The experience of watching Mosese’s visionary, much-lauded THIS IS NOT A BURIAL, IT’S A RESURRECTION is as timeless and elemental as the land itself."

Then, two friends become suspects in the murder of the woman they both love in David Eady’s whodunit “You Killed Elizabeth.” And finally, a typically commanding Orson Welles stars in (and reportedly largely directed) George More O’Ferrall’s “Lord Mountdrago,” in which one man uses the dreams of another in his twisted plot for revenge."

Set in the impoverished back alleys of Victorian London, THE THREEPENNY OPERA follows underworld antihero Mackie Messer (a.k.a.

The first American feature to be filmed in Vietnam in the aftermath of the war, Tony Bui’s gorgeous, richly textured portrait of everyday life in a rapidly changing, increasingly westernized Ho Chi Minh City follows the intersecting struggles, hopes, and dreams of a collection of ordinary people, including a young flower seller (Nguyễn Ngọc Hiệp) who forms a bond with an ailing poet; a rickshaw driver (Đơn Dương) who falls in love with a troubled sex worker; and an American former marine (Harvey Keitel) who fought in the war and has now returned to Vietnam to find the child he fathered years before. Winner of both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, the sublimely photographed Three Seasons captures aching moments of human connection in a city suspended between tradition and modernity."

A charming, spirited twist on the classic fairy tale, THREE WISHES FOR CINDERELLA updates the beloved story with a picturesque, woodsy wintertime setting and a refreshingly sharp-witted, assertive heroine (Libuše Šafránková), a housemaid who uses her wits and many talents—along with a bit of help from some magical hazelnuts—to win her prince and find her happily ever after."

As a hardened warrior who rises savagely to power, Toshiro Mifune gives a remarkable, animalistic performance, as does Isuzu Yamada as his ruthless wife.

While vacationing on a remote island retreat, a family finds its fragile ties tested when daughter Karin (an astonishing Harriet Andersson) discovers her father (Gunnar Björnstrand) has been using her schizophrenia for his own literary ends. As she drifts in and out of lucidity, Karin’s father, her husband (Max von Sydow), and her younger brother (Lars Passgård) are unable to prevent her descent into the abyss of mental illness. Winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY, the first work in Ingmar Bergman’s trilogy on faith and the loss of it, presents an unflinching vision of a family’s near disintegration and a tortured psyche further taunted by the intangibility of God’s presence."

Abbas Kiarostami takes metanarrative gamesmanship to masterful new heights in the final installment of THE KOKER TRILOGY. Unfolding “behind the scenes” of AND LIFE GOES ON, this film traces the complications that arise when the romantic misfortune of one of the actors—a young man who pines for the woman cast as his wife, even though, in real life, she will have nothing to do with him—creates turmoil on set and leaves the hapless director caught in the middle. An ineffably lovely, gentle human comedy steeped in the folkways of Iranian village life, THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES peels away layer after layer of artifice as it investigates the elusive, alchemical relationship between cinema and reality."

One of the most personal films by the prolific Hong Kong auteur Johnnie To is a thrilling love letter to both the cinema of Akira Kurosawa and the art and philosophy of judo. Amid the neon-drenched nightclubs and gambling dens of Hong Kong’s nocturnal underworld, the fates of three wandering souls—a former judo champion now barely scraping by as an alcoholic bar owner (Louis Koo), a young fighter (Aaron Kwok) intent on challenging him, and a singer (Cherrie Ying) chasing dreams of stardom—collide in an operatic explosion of human pain, ambition, perseverance, and redemption. Paying offbeat homage to Kurosawa’s debut feature, SANSHIRO SUGATA, To scrambles wild comedy, flights of lyrical surrealism, and rousing martial-arts action into what is ultimately a disarmingly touching ode to the healing power of friendship."

With extraordinary access and unflinching frankness, this remarkable, underseen documentary offers an X-ray of the soul of a divided America working through the social shockwaves of the civil rights movement. The film chronicles the struggles of Rev. L. William Youngdahl, pastor of the Augustana Lutheran Church in Omaha, Nebraska, as he tries to persuade members of his all-white congregation to reach out to their Black neighbors in an attempt to right some of the wrongs of systemic racism. A TIME FOR BURNING captures both the resistance of the white churchgoers, who speak candidly about their fears of integration, and the incisive perspectives of the Black residents (including firebrand activist and future state senator Ernie Chambers) who see through the hypocrisy of the church."

A true twentieth-century trailblazer, Harvey Milk was an outspoken human rights activist and one of the first openly gay U.S. politicians elected to public office; even after his assassination in 1978, he continues to inspire disenfranchised people around the world. The Oscar-winning The Times of Harvey Milk, directed by Robert Epstein and produced by Richard Schmiechen, was as groundbreaking as its subject. One of the first feature documentaries to address gay life in America, it&#39;s a work of advocacy itself, bringing Milk&#39;s message of hope and equality to a wider audience. This exhilarating trove of original documentary material and archival footage is as much a vivid portrait of a time and place (San Francisco&#39;s historic Castro District in the seventies) as a testament to the legacy of a political visionary."

Joseph Losey’s second British film after being blacklisted from Hollywood is forged with a feverish intensity, wringing maximum impact from the ticking-clock premise to make the audience feel the passage of every desperate second."

While the chaotic world around him careens toward the madness and folly of World War II, Oskar pounds incessantly on his beloved tin drum and perfects his uncannily piercing shrieks.

Thirty years in the making, TINY: THE LIFE OF ERIN BLACKWELL continues to follow one of the most indelible subjects of STREETWISE, a groundbreaking documentary on homeless and runaway teenagers. Erin Blackwell, a.k.a. Tiny, was introduced in filmmaker Martin Bell, photographer Mary Ellen Mark, and journalist Cheryl McCall&#39;s earlier film as a brash fourteen-year-old living precariously on the margins in Seattle. Now a forty-four year-old mother of ten, Blackwell reflects with Mark on the journey they’ve experienced together, from Blackwell’s struggles with addiction to her regrets to her dreams for her own children, even as she sees them being pulled down the same path of drugs and desperation. Interweaving three decades’ worth of Mark’s photographs and footage that includes previously unseen outtakes from STREETWISE, this is a heartrending, deeply empathetic portrait of a family struggling to break free of the cycle of trauma, as well as a summation of the life’s work of Mark, an irreplaceable artistic voice."

TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a Hollywood film of the boldest black humor, which went into production soon after the U.S. entered World War II.

The setup is simple: Low wage-earning dad Okajima is depending on his bonus, and so are his wife and children, yet payday doesn&#39;t exactly go as planned.

A spectacle of magnificent proportions and remarkable intimacy, Kon Ichikawa’s TOKYO OLYMPIAD remains one of the greatest films ever made about sports. Supervising a vast team of technicians using scores of cameras, Ichikawa captured the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo in glorious widescreen images, using cutting-edge telephoto lenses and exquisite slow motion to create lyrical, idiosyncratic poetry from the athletic drama surging all around him. Drawn equally to the psychology of losers and winners—including the legendary Ethiopian marathoner Abebe Bikila, who receives the film’s most exalted tribute—Ichikawa captures the triumph, passion, and suffering of competition with a singular humanistic vision, and in doing so effected a transformative influence on the art of documentary filmmaking."

Directed by Tony Richardson • 1963 • United Kingdom
Starring Albert Finney, Susannah York, Hugh Griffith

In the early 1960s, at the height of the British New Wave, director Tony Richardson and playwright John Osborne set out for more fanciful territory than the gritty realism of the movement they’d helped establish. TOM JONES brings a theatrical flair to Henry Fielding’s canonical eighteenth-century novel, boisterously chronicling the misadventures of the foundling of the title (Albert Finney, in a career-defining performance), whose easy charm seems to lead him astray at every turn from his beloved, the wellborn Sophie Western (Susannah York). This spirited picaresque, evocatively shot in England’s rambling countryside and featuring an extraordinary ensemble cast, went on to become a worldwide sensation, winning the Oscar for best picture on the way to securing its status as a classic of irreverent wit and playful cinematic expression."

Made, in director Marlon Riggs’s own words, to “shatter the nation’s brutalizing silence on matters of sexual and racial difference,” this radical blend of documentary and performance defies the stigmas surrounding Black gay sexuality in the belief that, as long as shame prevails, liberation cannot be possible. Through music and dance, words and poetry by such pathbreaking writers as Essex Hemphill and Joseph Beam—and by turns candid, humorous, and heartbreaking interviews with queer African American men—TONGUES UNTIED gives voice to what it means to live as an outsider in both a Black community rife with homophobia and a largely white gay subculture poisoned by racism. A lightning rod in the culture wars of the 1980s that incited a right-wing furor over public funding for the arts, the film has lost none of its life-affirming resonance."

From two-time Palme d’Or winners Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (TWO DAYS, ONE NIGHT) comes the story of seventeen-year-old Lokita and twelve-year-old Tori (in remarkable debut performances from Joely Mbundu and Pablo Schils), two immigrants—from Cameroon and Benin, respectively—whose sibling-like bond is the only resource they can depend on in their struggle for survival on the margins of European society. The inseparable pair work as performers in a cheap trattoria, dealing drugs on the side for the restaurant’s abusive cook, while balancing the demands of an indifferent bureaucracy and a band of violent smugglers. When Lokita is held captive while working in a marijuana grow house, Tori scrambles to save his companion from their abusers, as events spiral out of control. Winner of the 75th Anniversary Prize at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, the latest humanist drama from the Dardenne brothers is a heart-stopping thriller that casts an unflinching eye on the trials of the young and dispossessed.

Across fifteen jagged episodes, TOTALLY F***ED UP plunges headlong into the lives of a group of queer, disaffected Los Angeles teenagers who form a kind of makeshift family as they navigate desire and heartbreak, societal and familial rejection, and the alienation of growing up gay in an era of relentless moralizing.

In Chantal Akerman’s singular TOUTE UNE NUIT, the modern city and its inhabitants are captured in fragmentary, elliptical visions of desire, frustration, and loneliness, with more than two dozen characters appearing in fleeting vignettes that tease the possibility of larger narratives.

Directed by Ermanno Olmi • 1978 • Italy
Starring Luigi Ornaghi, Francesca Moriggi, Omar Brignoli

A painterly and sensual immersion in late nineteenth-century Italian farm life, Ermanno Olmi’s THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS lovingly focuses on four families working for one landowner on an isolated estate in the province of Bergamo. Filming on an abandoned farm for four months, Olmi adapted neorealist techniques to tell his story, enlisting local people to live as their own ancestors had, speaking in their native dialect on locations with which they were intimately familiar. Through the cycle of seasons, of backbreaking labor, love and marriage, birth and death, faith and superstition, Olmi naturalistically evokes an existence very close to nature, celebrating its beauty, humor, and simplicity but also acknowledging the feudal cruelty that governs it. Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1978, THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS is intimate in scale but epic in scope, a towering, heart-stirring work of humanist filmmaking.

Fourteen years after Hollywood ran aground with its film of Joan of Arc (starring Ingrid Bergman), French filmmaker Robert Bresson turned his attention to the last part of Joan&#39;s life, and the result was a stark and beautifully compact retelling of the tale, based on the actual surviving records of her trial. With Florence Delay as the martyred saint, in a presentation intended to make her accessible to modern younger viewers, the result was somewhere between a legitimate hagiographical film and the precursor to Zeffirelli&#39;s youth-oriented Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet, made a half-decade later."

Exiled from Hollywood and creatively unchained, Welles poured his ire at the studio system, the blacklist, and all forms of totalitarian oppression into this cinematic statement—a bold, personal film that he himself considered one of his greatest.

Homecoming queen by day and drug-addicted thrill seeker by night, Laura leads a double life that pulls her deeper and deeper into horror as she pieces together the identity of the assailant who has been terrorizing her for years. Nightmarish in its vision of an innocent torn apart by unfathomable forces, TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME is nevertheless one of Lynch&#39;s most humane films, aching with compassion for its tortured heroine, a character as enthralling in life as she was in death."

Two English Girls shows François Truffaut working in one of his favorite environments, the work of Henri-Pierre Roche (the author of Jules and Jim), with his longtime leading man/cinematic doppelganger Jean-Pierre Léaud, and telling a story so good on so many levels that he saved the narration for himself. As with many of Truffaut&#39;s best works (of which this is one, though it is often underrated), the story, of the romantic triangle between the two title characters and Léaud&#39;s Claude, is so beautifully delineated that the tale becomes almost secondary to its telling."

This ambitious TV movie by Jane Campion was heralded at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival as the arrival of a major new filmmaking voice. TWO FRIENDS’s screenplay, by renowned Australian novelist Helen Garner, is articulate, assured, and enthralling. The film begins in the present, when teenage friends Louise and Kelly, once inseparable, have already grown apart. Louise is in high school, gets good grades, and has a typical love-hate relationship with her divorced mother. Kelly, in bleached hair and punk gear, lives with friends at the beach and is experimenting with drugs and casual relationships. Campion then takes the film backward in time over the past year in the girls’ friendship. In five episodes, the film reveals the subtle changes that sent the two on their different paths. With the humor, fierce honesty, and passionate sense of humanity that are the hallmarks of Campion’s best work, she tells a story of missed opportunities and minor traumas that take on profound new meanings with the passage of time."

Two young schoolboys, Dara and Nader, are friends until Dara returns Nader’s notebook torn and Nader retaliates in kind, setting off an escalating battle that leads to destruction of property and physical injury. In the second solution, Dara realizes his offense and repairs the notebook, preserving the peace and the friendship. The film is shot mostly in close-ups, with a narrator drolly chronicling the action."

By the time he made UGETSU, Kenji Mizoguchi was already an elder statesman of Japanese cinema, fiercely revered by Akira Kurosawa and other directors of a younger generation. And with this exquisite ghost story, a fatalistic wartime tragedy derived from stories by Akinari Ueda and Guy de Maupassant, he created a touchstone of his art, his long takes and sweeping camera guiding the viewer through a delirious narrative about two villagers whose pursuit of fame and fortune leads them far astray from their loyal wives. Moving between the terrestrial and the otherworldly, UGETSU reveals essential truths about the ravages of war, the plight of women, and the pride of men.

Rich with historical detail and starkly beautiful black-and-white visuals, THE VALLEY OF THE BEES powerfully dramatizes the tension between personal freedom and religious fundamentalism."

With VAMPYR, Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer channeled his genius for creating mesmerizing atmosphere and austere, unsettling imagery into the horror genre. The result—a chilling film about a student of the occult who encounters supernatural haunts and local evildoers in a village outside of Paris—is nearly unclassifiable. A host of stunning camera and editing tricks and densely layered sounds create a mood of dreamlike terror. With its roiling fogs, ominous scythes, and foreboding echoes, VAMPYR is one of cinema’s great nightmares."

The final film from the late, beloved Agnès Varda is a characteristically playful, profound, and personal summation of the director’s own brilliant career. At once impish and wise, Varda acts as our spirit guide on a free-associative tour through her six-decade artistic journey, shedding new light on her films, photography, and recent installation works while offering her one-of-a-kind reflections on everything from filmmaking to feminism to aging. Suffused with the people, places, and things she loved—Jacques Demy, cats, colors, beaches, heart-shaped potatoes—the wonderfully idiosyncratic work of imaginative autobiography VARDA BY AGNÈS is a warmly human, touchingly bittersweet parting gift from one of cinema’s most luminous talents."

Though the details of what the division of duties was between the two directors are unclear, this lively backstage capriccio is unmistakably Felliniesque in its whimsical fascination with the heightened reality, carnivalesque characters, and exotic allure of the world of show business. In the first of her celebrated collaborations with her director husband, Giulietta Masina displays the spirited vulnerability that would soon become an archetype of cinematic emotiveness."

Among the players are Camille (Jeanne Balibar), an actor who has returned to France after three years in Italy to star in a production of Pirandello’s “As You Desire Me” and who must now confront the man she left behind; Ugo (Sergio Castellitto), the famed director and Camille’s lover, whose ulterior motive for coming to Paris is to uncover a long-lost, unpublished manuscript by the playwright Carlo Goldoni; and Dominique (Hélène de Fougerolles) the enigmatic student who becomes entwined in both their lives."

Brooke Adams delivers a revelatory, multilayered performance as Jo, a troubled woman who returns to her family home in Rhode Island to confront her childhood demons. There, she becomes unexpectedly embroiled in the simmering domestic discord next door.

As the seasons change, the family’s three very different daughters will each find their lives transformed.

A decade after making THE VIRGIN OF PESSAC, Jean Eustache filmed another documentary about his hometown’s annual coronation of a young woman of moral integrity. The differences between the two portraits of the same ritual are subtle yet telling: The selection process is slightly more fraught in the 1970s, as civic leaders are more concerned with the current economic depression than with broader social upheaval. In THE VIRGIN OF PESSAC 79, the ceremony also provides a stage on which progressive changes are made official, with a local order, the Fellows of Pleasant Pessac, inducting their first female member. Finally, the second time around, Eustache employs color photography, an appropriate choice given the event’s verdant spring setting."

As political and social tumult rocked France in May and June of 1968, Jean Eustache used his first documentary to focus on persistent tradition, in the form of a centuries-old ceremony in his hometown of Pessac. Each year, Pessac’s civic leaders choose a young woman they consider an exemplar of moral virtue, with a daylong celebration commemorating the changing of the guard from the previous year’s “virgin” to the present one. Eustache observes the exacting selection process, the fostering of communal bonds, and a bold implication by Pessac’s presiding priest that the ritual upholds the same Christian values for which leftist students and workers were then currently fighting."

The resulting films—ranging from the arresting abstraction of Penn’s pure cinema study of pole-vaulters to the playful irreverence of Forman’s musical take on the decathlon to Schlesinger’s haunting portrait of the single-minded solitude of a marathon runner—are triumphs of personal, poetic vision applied to one of the pinnacles of human achievement."

Two strangers dressed as minstrels (Arletty and Alain Cuny) arrive at a castle in advance of court festivities—and are revealed to be emissaries of the devil, dispatched to spread heartbreak and suffering. Their plans, however, are thwarted by an unexpected intrusion: human love. Often interpreted as an allegory for the Nazi occupation of France, during which it was made, LES VISITEURS DU SOIR—wittily written by Jacques Prévert and Pierre Laroche, and elegantly designed by Alexandre Trauner and shot by Roger Hubert—is a moving tale of love conquering all."

VIVRE SA VIE (a.k.a. MY LIFE TO LIVE) was a turning point for Jean-Luc Godard and remains one of his most dynamic films, combining brilliant visual design with a tragic character study. The lovely Anna Karina, Godard’s greatest muse, plays Nana, a young Parisian who aspires to be an actress but instead ends up a prostitute, her downward spiral depicted in a series of discrete tableaux of daydreams and dances. Featuring some of Karina and Godard’s most iconic moments, from her movie theater vigil with THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC to her seductive pool-hall strut, VIVRE SA VIE is a landmark of the French New Wave that still surprises at every turn."

Starring Barbara Loden, Michael Higgins

With her first and only feature film—a hard-luck drama she wrote, directed, and starred in—Barbara Loden turned in a groundbreaking work of American independent cinema, bringing to life a kind of character seldom seen on-screen. Set amid a soot-choked Pennsylvania landscape, and shot in an intensely intimate vérité style, the film takes up with distant and soft-spoken Wanda (Loden), who has left her husband, lost custody of her children, and now finds herself alone, drifting between dingy bars and motels, where she falls prey to a series of callous men—including a bank robber who ropes her into his next criminal scheme. An until now difficult-to-see masterpiece that has nonetheless exerted an outsize influence on generations of artists and filmmakers, WANDA is a compassionate and wrenching portrait of a woman stranded on society’s margins.

Starring John Hurt, Richard Briers, Michael Graham-Cox

With this passion project, screenwriter-producer-director Martin Rosen brilliantly achieved what had been thought nearly impossible: a faithful big-screen adaptation of Richard Adams’s classic British dystopian novel about a community of rabbits under terrible threat from modern forces. With its naturalistic hand-drawn animation, dreamily expressionistic touches, gorgeously bucolic background design, and elegant voice work from such superb English actors as John Hurt, Ralph Richardson, Richard Briers, and Denholm Elliott, WATERSHIP DOWN is an emotionally arresting, dark-toned allegory about freedom amid political turmoil."

Starring Nino Manfredi, Vittorio Gassman, Stefania Sandrelli

This beloved classic of commedia all’italiana is a beautifully bittersweet tale of friendship, nostalgia, and cinema. Over the course of thirty years, we follow the lives of three friends—Antonio (Nino Manfredi), Gianni (Vittorio Gassman), and Nicola (Stefano Satta Flores)—who go from fighting the Nazis together during World War II to experiencing the full spectrum of life’s joys and disappointments as they see their once-strong bond tested by love, politics, and time. Studded with allusions to Italian film history—including a cameo from Federico Fellini and Marcello Mastroianni recreating the famed Trevi Fountain sequence from LA DOLCE VITA—WE ALL LOVED EACH OTHER SO MUCH is a film as rich in humor and melancholy as life itself."

This scathing late-sixties satire from Jean-Luc Godard is one of cinema’s great anarchic works. Determined to collect an inheritance from a dying relative, a bourgeois couple travel across the French countryside while civilization crashes and burns around them. Featuring a justly famous sequence in which the camera tracks along a seemingly endless traffic jam, and rich with historical and literary references, WEEKEND is a surreally funny and disturbing call for revolution, a depiction of society reverting to savagery, and—according to the credits—the end of cinema itself."

This sensual, remarkably observed, beautifully acted wonder is the breakout feature from British writer-director-editor Andrew Haigh. Rarely has a film been as honest about sexuality—in both depiction and discussion—as this tale of a one-night stand that develops into a weekend-long idyll for two very different young men (exciting screen newcomers Tom Cullen and Chris New) in the English Midlands. It’s an emotionally naked film that’s at once an invaluable snapshot of the complexities of contemporary gay living and a universally resonant portrait of a love affair."

Harold Lloyd’s first talkie was originally filmed as a silent feature, only to be largely reshot to capitalize on the nascent sound technology. Here, the ever hapless everyman plays Harold Bledsoe, a timid botany student who, due to his late father’s position as San Francisco police chief, is called in to help investigate a growing crime wave in the city’s Chinatown, leading him on a wild slapstick goose chase to catch a shadowy crime boss."

Ngozi Onwurah’s radically ahead-of-its-time Afrofuturist vision WELCOME II THE TERRORDOME made history as the first theatrically distributed British feature directed by a Black woman. Nevertheless, it was largely dismissed upon its release by critics unable to see the urgency in its evocation of a gritty dystopia in which Black people have been relegated to living in a slum called the Terrordome, where simmering racial tension threatens to boil over in the wake of a young boy’s death. Twenty-five years later, Onwurah’s fusion of political commentary and genre spectacle looks positively prescient, and her ability to build an entire cosmology that connects the history of slavery to present-day police brutality is nothing less than visionary."

A distant land shrouded in myth and rumor, America looms large in the cultural imagination of a quiet Castilian village, whose impressionable inhabitants dream of benefitting from the country’s postwar plans to aid Europe. When word gets out that a delegation of U.S. diplomats plans to pay a visit, the townsfolk of Villar del Río waste no time in erecting a fantasy worthy of Uncle Sam’s favor, transforming their austere surroundings into a tourist-friendly vision of Andalusian kitsch. With a sly irreverence that led Cannes juror Edward G.

G. W. Pabst brought the war movie into a new era with his first sound film, a mercilessly realistic depiction of the nightmare that scarred a generation, in Germany and beyond. Digging into the trenches with four infantrymen stationed in France in the final months of World War I, Pabst illustrates the harrowing ordeals of battle with unprecedented naturalism, as the men are worn away in body and spirit by firefights, shelling, and the disillusion that greets them on the home front. Long unavailable, the newly restored WESTFRONT 1918 is a visceral, sobering antiwar statement that is as urgent today as when it was made."

Mauritanian French director Med Hondo’s staggering WEST INDIES: THE FUGITIVE SLAVES OF LIBERTY is a sui generis amalgam of historical epic, Broadway revue, Brechtian theater, and joyous agitprop. Using an enormous mock slave ship as the film’s only soundstage, Hondo mounts intricately choreographed reenactments and dance numbers across his multipurpose set to investigate more than three centuries of imperialist oppression. The story traverses the West Indies, Europe, and the Middle Passage; jumps across time to depict the effects of official French policy upon the colonized, the enslaved, and their descendants; and surveys the actions and motivations of the resigned, the revolutionary, and the powers that be (along with their lackeys). No mere extravaganza, WEST INDIES is a call to arms for a spectacular yet critical cinematic reimagining of an entire people’s history of resistance and struggle."

When modern, liberated Setsuko (Michiko Kuwano) visits her meek uncle Komiya (Tatsuo Saito), it’s not long before she sets about meddling in his relationship with his domineering socialite wife (Sumiko Kurishima), turning the gender dynamics in the household upside down.

On the way, he connects with a barely competent tour guide named Kumi and the shapeshifting, loudmouthed and lovable thief Akane. Upon returning home with this merry band of schemers, Gau Shin finds his family of resourceful counterfeiters on the verge of expropriation: a multinational conglomerate led by a ruthless Japanese developer has found the village, and is determined to raze it to build the new center of world trade! A breathless, kaleidoscopic evocation of a specific pan-Asian cultural experience as the 1990s drew near, this rare bilingual Japan–Hong Kong coproduction unfolds as part unhinged globalization mini-epic, part fringe documentary, as director Masashi Yamamoto brings his project—of capturing beauty and resilience in the margins of capital—to its maximalist apex."

Widely regarded as one of the greatest Vietnamese films ever made, this deeply moving exploration of grief and trauma centers on Duyên (Lê Vân), a young woman whose husband is killed in Vietnam’s post-reunification war with Cambodia. Choosing to conceal the news of his death from her loved ones, she enlists a schoolteacher to help her maintain the ruse by writing letters that appear to be from her husband—leading her into a profound emotional conflict as she wrestles with guilt and loss. Graced with a lyrical feeling for the landscapes of the Vietnamese countryside, WHEN THE TENTH MONTH COMES gives empathetic voice to the experiences of those who must go on living in the face of war’s devastation."

 In 1974, Leon Gast traveled to Africa to film Zaïre 74, a music festival planned to accompany an unprecedented sports spectacle: the Rumble in the Jungle, in which late-career underdog Muhammad Ali would contend with the younger powerhouse George Foreman for the boxing heavyweight championship title—“a fight between two Blacks in a Black nation, organized by Blacks,” as a Kinshasa billboard put it. When the main event was delayed, extending Ali’s stay in Africa, Gast wound up amassing a treasure trove of footage, observing the wildly charismatic athlete training for one of the toughest bouts of his career while basking in his role as Black America’s proud ambassador to postcolonial Africa. Two decades in the making, WHEN WE WERE KINGS features interviews with Norman Mailer and George Plimpton that illustrate the sensational impact of the fight, rounding out an Academy Award–winning portrait of Ali that captures his charm, grace, and defiance."

Academy Award–winning documentary filmmakers Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman take a journey through unfamiliar lands—in their own country. Having spent most of their lives on one coast or the other, they wondered what they could learn from the people in between. Piling into a van with a film crew, the pair connect with ordinary Americans who talk sometimes eloquently, often poignantly about their lives, hopes, and dreams. Made at a time when the country was sharply divided over the Gulf War and LGBTQ issues, the film remains a timely document of two filmmakers trying to find common ground with people from different backgrounds than their own."

The first film in Abbas Kiarostami’s sublime, interlacing KOKER TRILOGY takes a simple premise—a boy searches for the home of his classmate, whose school notebook he has accidentally taken—and transforms it into a miraculous, child’s-eye adventure of the everyday. As our young hero zigzags determinedly across two towns, aided (and sometimes misdirected) by those he encounters, his quest becomes both a revealing portrait of rural Iranian society in all its richness and complexity and a touching parable about the meaning of personal responsibility. Sensitive and profound, WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE? is shot through with all the beauty, tension, and wonder a single day can contain."

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Yasujiro Ozu made a string of comedies dealing with student life, the last of which, WHERE NOW ARE THE DREAMS OF YOUTH?, finds the director exploring increasingly complex themes of class and labor. After cheating his way through university alongside his three buddies, Horino (Ureo Egawa) inherits his late father’s company and sets his friends up with jobs. But can their once-carefree friendship survive the thorny realities of the working world? (Presented without score.)"

Amid the vast flatlands of the Camargue in the South of France lives White Mane, a magnificent wild stallion who refuses to be broken by men and instead forms a connection with a young boy, with whom he embarks on a daring quest for freedom. Fully capturing the rugged beauty of its marsh setting, this extraordinarily photographed treasure of children’s cinema—which won the Grand Prix for Best Short Film at the Cannes Film Festival—speaks to the hearts of all creatures yearning to live untamed."

Played by a ferocious Isabelle Huppert, Maria is an entitled white woman living in Africa, desperately unwilling to give up her family’s crumbling coffee plantation despite the civil war closing in on her. Created with Denis’ signature full-throttle visual style, which places the viewer at the center of the maelstrom, WHITE MATERIAL is a gripping evocation of the death throes of European colonialism and a fascinating look at a woman lost in her own mind."

WHITE VERTIGO is one of the unexpected jewels of this Olympic films collection.

Director Giorgio Ferroni knows how to film the key disciplines, even if they are far removed from his specialties, the sword- and-sandal and pulp fiction genres. The music, by the prolific Angelo Francesco Lavagnino (OTHELLO and CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT), audaciously uses jazz piano to accompany the ice hockey matches, bringing a lyrical mood to a sport that in other Olympic Games documentaries is portrayed in ferocious terms."

Sculptor Franco Serpieri (Lazenby) welcomes Roberta (Nicoletta Elmi), his young daughter from a failed marriage, to Venice, unaware that a disturbed child-killer is stalking the city’s canals. When Roberta’s body is found floating face-down in the river, the lives of Franco and his estranged wife Elizabeth (Anita Strindberg) are ripped asunder. Desperate for vengeance, Franco turns detective in a bid to track down his daughter’s killer, and in the process unearths shocking evidence of depravity and corruption which implicates some of the most respected figures in Venetian society."

WILD WHEELS is filmmaker Harrod Blank’s comic and revealing exploration of art cars —customized automobiles that reflect the individualistic spirit of their drivers. Traveling across the U.S. in his own wildly decorated VW bug, Blank discovers a memorable array of real-life characters obsessed with transforming their cars into mobile works of art. The result is an engaging and irresistibly eccentric deep dive into the heart of a truly unique, all-American subculture."

Starring Mauro Costa, André Cabral, Joel Branco

A rapturously queer, ecologically minded, antiroyalist musical fantasia, WILL-O’-THE-WISP finds the ever-audacious João Pedro Rodrigues (The Ornithologist) at his most playfully and pleasurably subversive. It’s the year 2069 (nice), and, on his deathbed, his royal highness Alfredo (Joel Branco/Mauro Costa), king without a crown, is taken back to his distant youth via euphorically erotic memories of his time as a fireman. Dismayed by the ever-more-frequent forest fires caused by climate change, the young king-to-be joins a brigade of blaze-extinguishing beefcakes with a penchant for sexy art-historical role-play. An encounter with veteran firefighter Afonso (André Cabral) opens a new chapter in the lives of the two young men, igniting both burning desire and a determination to change the status quo."

But when he falls in love with a beautiful trapeze artist, he is willing to give up his immortality and come back to earth to be with her. Made not long before the fall of the Berlin wall, this stunning tapestry of sounds and images, shot in black and white and color by the legendary Henri Alekan, is movie poetry. And it forever made the name Wim Wenders synonymous with film art."

“God, why hast thou forsaken me?” With WINTER LIGHT, Ingmar Bergman explores the search for redemption in a meaningless existence. Small-town pastor Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Björnstrand) performs his duties mechanically before a dwindling congregation, including his stubbornly devoted lover, Märta (Ingrid Thulin). When he is asked to assuage a troubled parishioner’s (Max von Sydow) debilitating fear of nuclear annihilation, Tomas is terrified to find that he can provide nothing but his own doubt. The beautifully photographed WINTER LIGHT is an unsettling look at the human craving for personal validation in a world seemingly abandoned by God."

Cowritten by Ester Krumbachová and director Otakar Vávra, this unsettling parable uses seventeenth-century religious hysteria as a potent allegory for the repressive political climate of Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia. In the 1670s in Moravia, the ruthless inquisitor Boblig von Edelstadt (a real historical figure, played by Vladimír Šmeral) stages a series of sensational witch trials, using persecution, torture, and terror to force women to confess to devil worship.

Grant and Paul McGann as, respectively, Withnail and “I,” a pair of perpetually soused, unemployed actors in 1960s London who, desperate to escape their nightmarishly grimy flat, embark on a hilariously misbegotten country getaway beset by menacing locals, bare cupboards, and a randy uncle—all of which they may be able to withstand as long as they don’t run out of alcohol. While Robinson’s dazzling script yields quotable moments galore, it’s the film’s bittersweet evocation of a friendship gradually unraveling that gives this beloved end-of-youth tale its lasting poignancy."

Simon Wolberg (François Damiens), mayor of a small provincial town, knows more about American soul music than what is happening in his family.

Each suspect remembers her differently. Was Agnes a beautiful, well-bred lady? A slovenly, raging drunk? Can we ever understand the truth of another person’s life?

One of the 1960s’ great international art-house sensations, WOMAN IN THE DUNES (SUNA NO ONNA) was for many the grand unveiling of the surreal, idiosyncratic world of Hiroshi Teshigahara. Eiji Okada plays an amateur entomologist who has left Tokyo to study an unclassified species of beetle found in a vast desert. When he misses his bus back to civilization, he is persuaded to spend the night with a young widow (Kyoko Kishida) in her hut at the bottom of a sand dune. What results is one of cinema’s most unnerving and palpably erotic battles of the sexes, as well as a nightmarish depiction of everyday life as a Sisyphean struggle—an achievement that garnered Teshigahara an Academy Award nomination for best director."

Remarkable for its psychological nuance and its boldly modern perspective on an independent woman’s search for fulfillment, Charlie Chaplin’s long-overlooked silent masterpiece A WOMAN OF PARIS is a revelation. Chaplin confounded 1923 audiences with this unexpected foray into serious drama, and by ceding the spotlight to his longtime screen partner Edna Purviance. She is captivating as the vivacious Marie St. Clair, a “woman of fate” who leaves behind her small-minded village for the glamour of Paris, where she finds herself at the center of a Jazz Age whirl of champagne soirees, luxurious pleasure-seeking, romance, and tragedy. Putting aside his Little Tramp persona, Chaplin’s second feature proved that, beyond being a comic genius, he was an artist of immense sensitivity and human understanding."

With examples from 1943 to 2013, from China to Iran, Australia to Finland, we look at how to open a film: from mysterious, direct, floating, foreboding beginnings to plunging straight in. All are instructive in how to create an immediate world. 

“Tone”
What’s the tone of a film—not its story or theme, but what its world feels like? Back to Hollywood and director Dorothy Arzner with MERRILY WE GO TO HELL and its glamorous, amorous mood. This chapter looks at the myriad ways in which directors set the tones of their films: delight, anger, poetry, double tones, moral seriousness, caring, edginess, violence."

“Sci-Fi”
Our look at sci-fi takes us to unusual places, other realms: Kathryn Bigelow, the Wachowski siblings, Patty Jenkins’s WONDER WOMAN, Lori Petty’s TANK GIRL, and the TV version of Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale.” 

“Horror &amp;amp; Hell”
Literal, figurative, political—in Deepa Mehta’s EARTH, Samira Makhmalbaf’s BLACKBOARDS, Jennifer Kent’s horror masterpiece THE BABADOOK, Joanna Hogg’s squirm-inducing ARCHIPELAGO, the Tunisian film THE SILENCES OF THE PALACE, and more."

It’s easy to spot, but not so easy to understand. Believability is about simple human stories, truth about life, real emotions, responding to the world. How do directors create a reality without it feeling fake? True stories can help. But what’s the trick? Here are some answers, drawing from Lois Weber’s THE BLOT and Maren Ade’s TONI ERDMANN.

“Introducing Character”
Going to a house, overhearing people, witnessing bizarre action—there are many ways to meet people and be introduced to characters in films. In Shirley Clarke’s THE CONNECTION, she has a documentary crew introduce the characters to us; Andrea Arnold puts her characters front and center in FISH TANK; and in THE STORY OF THE FLAMING YEARS, directed by Yuliya Solntseva, the main character is presented like a statue on a building.

“Meet Cute”
The classic Hollywood trope of a “meet cute” invites a variety of interpretations, from intimate glimpses to worlds colliding spectacularly. Unique examples include the feverish, pivotal meet cute in Germaine Dulac’s experimental THE SEASHELL AND THE CLERGYMAN, Céline Sciamma playing two girl gangs against each other in GIRLHOOD, and the cynical FBI old guard meeting the idealistic newcomer in Kathryn Bigelow’s POINT BREAK. Then, a masterfully choreographed, layered meet cute in Mania Akbari’s ONE.TWO.ONE is captured in a single wide shot composed like a Renaissance altarpiece."

“Conversation”
A basic human interaction—how to make it cinematic? Angela Schanelec directs us to focus on body language in PLACES IN CITIES, Cecile Tang uses the zoom as guide through the emotional shifts in THE ARCH, and Sofia Coppola in THE VIRGIN SUICIDES shows us an unspoken conversation, with songs and split screens telling a story of impossible longing.

“Framing”
Frames describe and paint the scenes. They can make sport look balletic, like in controversial Nazi iconographer’s Leni Riefenstahl’s OLYMPIA. They shape the cinematic world—through impressionist glances in Kathryn Bigelow’s BLUE STEEL, suffocating close-ups in Lucrecia Martel’s THE HOLY GIRL, and camera angles as extreme as the titular character’s emotions in Mahalia Belo’s ELLEN.

“Tracking”
Tracking shots are to many an essence of filmmaking magic. They can ask questions and speak when hardly anyone else in the film is talking—like in Chantal Akerman’s FROM THE EAST or Marion Hänsel’s LE LIT. In Antonia Bird’s FACE, a seamless tracking shot gives us an illusion of the camera being an extension of our eyes. Kinetic in nature, tracking can help dynamically show and express a desperate escape, like in Ursula Meier’s HOME."

“Staging”
Scene staging is an element of film form pointing clearly to cinema’s origin: theater. Kinuyo Tanaka uses staging in THE MOON HAS RISEN to shape the scene’s invisible geometry, accentuating the tension between characters. Maren Ade stages through depth in TONI ERDMANN, facilitating the tragicomic punch line. And in Maria Schrader’s STEFAN ZWEIG: FAREWELL TO EUROPE, the crisscrossing staging in the final scene makes its location come alive.

“Journey”
Movement is key to a motion picture, and journeys in film can be horizontal as well as vertical (into the self). Travel can be like glue and bind characters from two different worlds, like when a middle-class woman and working-class man go on a moral journey against society in KRANE’S CONFECTIONERY. Driving can be a test of will and courage, like in Nell Shipman’s SOMETHING NEW. A mode of transportation can serve as a safe space and a social microcosm, like the car in Andrea Arnold’s AMERICAN HONEY. Or, like in Jennifer Kent’s THE BABADOOK, it can take the character on a journey into her nightmares.

“Discovery”
Discovery and revelation shape some of cinema’s most iconic moments. But beyond the best-known scenes, there lies the humanity, craft, and insight of discovery—like in Céline Sciamma’s TOMBOY, when the mother suddenly sees her child in a new light. There’s the discovery of the opposite sex’s naked form, like in the male-gaze-flipping scene from Patty Jenkins’s WONDER  WOMAN. Then, in Sabiha Sumar’s SILENT WATERS, the audience is guided through a discovery that changes everything about how they view the story."

“Adult/Child”
Most famous movie genres—war pictures, westerns, etc.—are about adults, but in this chapter, Jane Fonda narrates the story of eighteen films about children, from Germany, Belgium, Mongolia, Sweden, Russia, Canada, Senegal, Argentina, and Scotland.

“Economy”
We’ve all seen overblown films, but what are the visual and story lessons we can learn from Claire Denis, Maria Louisa Bemberg, Kinuyo Tanaka, Agnès Varda, Valeska Grisebach, and Desiree Akhavan about keeping things simple?

“Editing”
How have filmmakers like Ava Du Vernay, Kathryn Bigelow, Sarah Maldoror, Leni Riefentahl, and Drahoméra Vihanová and their editors pushed the techniques of editing to their limits?"

“POV”
Is cinema the art of point of view? Jocelyn Moorhouse, Ida Lupino, Edith Carlmar, Sofia Coppola, Liliana Cavani, Kelly Reichardt, Larisa Shepitko, Jennifer Kent, and other great directors demonstrate the art of POV.

“Close-Up”
Films from Belgium, Hungary, Australia, Finland, China, the United States, France, Germany and Ukraine, shot over ten decades, show how close-ups create intensity.

“Dream”
One of the great movie stars, India’s Sharmila Tagore, narrates this bold chapter that looks at dreams in films, including WAYNE’S WORLD, Jane Campion, Sally Potter, and silent movies."

“Bodies”
Bodies in cinema can be enticing, athletic, or brutalized. Jane Fonda narrates this chapter about how some of the great directors—including Agnès Varda, Andrea Arnold, Marva Nabili, Pirjo Honkasalo, Márta Mészáros, and Wanda Jakubowska—have filmed bodies.

“Sex”
From bodies to sex—one of the most controversial aspects of film. In this chapter Diane Kurys, Lucile Hadžihalilović, Jamie Babbit, Safi Faye, Athina Rachel Tsangari, Alison de Vere, Carine Adler, Donna Deitch, Miranda July, Lucía Puenzo, Maren Ade, Chantal Akerman, and others show a variety of ways of showing sex on screen."

“Home”
Refuge, shelter, or prison? Sharmila Tagore narrates the story of home on-screen in the great films of Edith Carlmar, Lynne Ramsay, Mai Zetterling, Liu Jiayin, Forough Farrokhzad, Antonia Bird, and others.

“Religion”
Narrator Sharmila Tagore takes us on a global tour of great films about religion. We start in the U.S. in the 1910s, go to Sri Lanka in the ’70s, and dip into the work of Lucrecia Martel, Jessica Hausner, and Marjane Satrapi.

“Work”
Work seems too unglamorous for cinema, but as narrator Jane Fonda tells us, in films like AMERICAN HONEY, the silent Russian masterpiece WOMEN OF RYAZAN, Venezuela’s ARAYA, Patty Jenkins’s MONSTER, and Mary Harron’s AMERICAN PSYCHO, some of the most engrossing scenes show work."

“Politics”
Another aspect of everyday life. From silent cinema to the twenty-first century, movies from the visually astonishing THE ENCHANTED DESNA to DIVORCE IRANIAN STYLE to STRANGE DAYS have gained their energy and attack from their politics.

“Gear Change”
We like to be taken by surprise in films. This short chapter, narrated by Sharmila Tagore, looks at such surprises.

“Comedy”
Is comedy universal? Who have been the great comedy filmmakers around the world? Narrator Sharmila Tagore talks us through scenes from BIG with Tom Hanks, Ida Lupino’s THE TROUBLE WITH ANGELS, the great movies of Elaine May, the classic Norwegian comedy FOOLS IN THE MOUNTAINS, and more."

In the lush backwoods of Mississippi and Alabama, history is being made. Poor Black and white working people are trying to overcome the forces of racism to organize into cooperative associations and dispel the bonds of their economic captors—the paper and pulpwood companies. In his final feature-length work, director Lionel Rogosin allows his subjects to tell and live their own story. We see them in their homes, with their families, and in the forests, which provide them the things that make them woodcutters: trees and freedom. Interviews with the men directly involved in the formation of the group—the Gulf-Coast Pulpwood Association—reveal the intricacies of this venture, an inspiring depiction of unity among workers across racial lines."

Using a masterful arsenal of film techniques, from haunting matte paintings to jarring documentary-like camerawork in the film&#39;s battle sequences, Bernard created a pacifist work of enormous empathy and chilling despair.

More than forty years ago, in 1978, WORD IS OUT: STORIES OF SOME OF OUR LIVES startled audiences across the country when it appeared in movie theaters and on television. The first feature-length documentary about queer identity made by gay filmmakers, the film was created by the Mariposa Film Group, a collective comprised of three lesbians (Veronica Selver, Lucy Massie Phenix, Nancy Adair) and three gay men (Rob Epstein, Peter Adair, Andrew Brown). Featuring candid interviews with twenty-six gay men and women across a wide range of demographics, it became an immediate flash point in the emerging gay-rights movement of the 1970s and forever altered the cultural conversation around LGBT issues."

Inspired by the experiences of the sex workers Borden met while making her underground feminist landmark BORN IN FLAMES, WORKING GIRLS reveals the textures of a day in the life of Molly (Louise Smith), a photographer working part-time in a Manhattan brothel, as she juggles a steady stream of clients, balances nurturing relationships with her coworkers with the demands of an ambitious madam, and above all fights to maintain her sense of self in a business in which the line between the personal and the professional is all too easily blurred. In viewing prostitution through the lens of labor, Borden boldly desensationalizes the subject, offering an empathetic, humanizing, often humorous depiction of women for whom this work is just another day at the office."

Starring Wang Hongwei, Hao Hongjian, Zuo Baitao

The feature debut of visionary director Jia Zhangke announced the arrival of arguably the most important Chinese filmmaker of his generation. Left behind by friends who have taken advantage of the changing economy and moved on with their lives, aimless pickpocket Xiao Wu (Wang Hongwei) drifts into a relationship with a sex worker (Hao Hongjian) as he begins to question the purpose of his existence. Shot guerrilla style in 16 mm with a cast of nonprofessional actors, XIAO WU is at once an intimate character study and a trenchant examination of the political and economic forces reshaping Chinese society in the 1990s."

Starring Hideko Takamine, Yuzo Kayama, Mitsuko Kusabue

One of Mikio Naruse’s supreme achievements, this transcendent melodrama weaves a heartrending story of an extended family tragedy growing out of the Second World War. The great Hideko Takamine stars as a young widow attempting to carry on after her husband was killed in the war and her family grocery all but wiped out in a bombing raid. She keeps the business going, only to find herself dealing with the greedy interference of her sisters-in-law and the unwanted attention of her brother-in-law (Yuzo Kayama), who all the while pines for her. It all builds to a shattering, train-set emotional climax, subtly yet powerfully enacted by the director’s muse Takamine."

Winner of the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar at the 1964 Academy Awards, YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW is a sparklingly original comedy that casts Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren in three different stories set throughout Italy. In Naples, they are poor but resourceful, selling black-market cigarettes on the streets. In Milan, Loren is costumed in Christian Dior and debates her preference for a Rolls Royce or her husband. And in Rome, Mastroianni is an industry scion who helps Loren’s sex worker set a wavering priest back onto the spiritual plane. Witty and unforgettable, this gem from master filmmaker Vittorio De Sica is picture-postcard beautiful and effortlessly hilarious."

The star-filmmaker shows his increasing confidence with this endlessly inventive tale of a martial-arts student (Chan) who goes in search of his exiled brother, only to become entangled in a case of mistaken identity—with much amusement provided by Chan’s interplay with his real-life former schoolmate Yuen Biao.

The changes keep coming as a murder sets off a police investigation and waves of controversy in London’s Black community. The year is 1977, and while some people are busy getting ready to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s Silver Jubilee, others have more important things on their minds. Punks and Teds, National Front and Natty Dreads are fighting in the streets, and the authorities seem more interested in harassing the victim’s friends than in solving the crime.

Directed by Kazuo Mori • 1965 • Japan

An elderly prisoner accused of murder begs Zatoichi to find evidence of his innocence. The blind swordsman, for the first time, chooses not to help, but fate has other plans for him. Director Issei Mori, who played a significant role in getting Shintaro Katsu cast as Zatoichi in the first place, shows his filmmaking flair, delivering bloody battles and raucous humor while mischievously upending narrative expectations."

The wandering swordsman finds himself in a small village that serves as hideout for a band of fugitives who control the town officials and enforce brutal slave labor in the local silk mill. This lean and mean entry is packed with coldhearted villainy and rough justice, but it finds its heart in the great Takashi Shimura (IKIRU), who plays a kindly country doctor caught up in a violent world."

Zatoichi comes across a pregnant woman dying from sword wounds and helps deliver her baby. Her final request to him: take the boy to see his father. From here, the film evolves into one of the wilder rides in the ZATOICHI series, including such quirky touches as a mysterious child who follows Ichi and pelts him with rocks, monkey performances, and an unexpectedly hilarious take on the ronin challenger."

Determined to bring father and son together, Zatoichi pits his skills against the gangsters and a ronin who is not entirely what he seems."

Star Shintaro Katsu sits in the director’s chair for this psychedelic and unremittingly bleak entry in the Zatoichi series, which is unlike any other in its grind-house grimness. A tale of innocence corrupted by sadistic, sleazy criminality, the film is propelled by EASY RIDER-esque editing and a trippy seventies funk score by Kunihiko Murai."

Unfortunately, he finds that a childhood friend has become a feared crime lord, keeping the locals in debt and bilking them of their rice.

Based on a popular novel by Raymond Queneau that had been considered unadaptable, Malle’s audacious ZAZIE DANS LE MÉTRO (“Zazie in the Metro”), made with flair on the cusp of the French New Wave, is a bit of stream-of-consciousness slapstick, wall-to-wall with visual gags, editing tricks, and effects."
